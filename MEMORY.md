## Phase 0 — Documentation & Project Charter
*Completed 2026-09-06*

### The pivot that defined the project

The project was initially framed as React + FastAPI. It was changed, on the
mentor's requirement, to a **native Odoo 18 custom module** before any code was
written.

**Consequences that everything else follows from:**
- Odoo is both backend and frontend — Odoo ORM for logic, Odoo views + OWL 2 for UI
- Security is Odoo's own `res.groups`, ACLs, record rules and Portal
- No React, no FastAPI, no Celery, no Redis, no Nginx in the standard stack
- Exactly two containers: `web` (`odoo:18.0`) and `db` (`postgres:15`)
- `ir.cron` replaces Celery; Odoo's own web server replaces Nginx in development

This is recorded here because it is the single most important constraint in the
project, and a future session must not drift back toward the original framing.

### Decisions

**D0.1 — Odoo 18 Community capability was verified against source, not assumed.**
Blog posts and forum answers contradict each other on what Community includes.
Checked directly against `odoo/odoo@18.0` for `addons/<module>/__manifest__.py`:

| Present | Absent (Enterprise) |
|---|---|
| `mrp`, `mrp_account`, `mrp_subcontracting` | `mrp_workorder` (Shop Floor app) |
| `maintenance` | `web_gantt` (Gantt views) |
| `hr`, `resource`, `stock`, `product` | `mrp_maintenance` (workcenter↔equipment bridge) |
| `portal`, `base_automation`, `base_import` | `quality_control` |
| `sale_management`, `spreadsheet_dashboard`, `board` | |

Also confirmed in source: `mrp.workcenter` already has `oee`, `oee_target`,
`time_efficiency`, `_compute_oee()`; `maintenance.equipment` already has `mtbf`,
`mttr`, `expected_mtbf`, `latest_failure_date`, `estimated_next_failure`.

**Why it matters:** three requested capabilities (Shop Floor terminal, Gantt
scheduling, equipment bridge) must be built in-house. Discovering this in Phase 4
instead of Phase 0 would have derailed the plan.

**D0.2 — Downtime reuses `mrp.workcenter.productivity`, not a new model.**
Odoo's `_compute_oee()` derives OEE from productive versus blocked time on this
model. A parallel downtime model would leave native OEE permanently wrong.
`mrp.workcenter.productivity.loss` is already a loss-reason master with a
`loss_type` classification (availability / performance / quality / productive),
which is exactly the taxonomy the customer's downtime list implies.
*(ADR-001)*

**D0.3 — Custom OWL Shop-Floor Terminal instead of the Enterprise app.**
Not only forced by edition, but better: the stock app does not capture output,
downtime reason and manpower in one flow, which is what this plant needs. Tablet-first,
operator-scoped by the daily allocation roster, optimistic writes with retry.
*(ADR-002)*

**D0.4 — Custom scheduling board instead of Gantt or an OCA backport.**
`web_gantt` is Enterprise. An OCA substitute would mean a third-party dependency
with its own 18.0 compatibility and upgrade risk on a core screen. A purpose-built
board (machines × date-shift, coloured by load vs capacity) is similar effort,
no dependency, and answers the planner's actual question.
*(ADR-003)*

**D0.5 — Analytics read from SQL views, not Python aggregation.**
Four `_auto = False` models: `fmes.production.report`, `fmes.downtime.report`,
`fmes.utilization.report`, `fmes.maintenance.report`. The customer wants
historical trends; Python-side aggregation degrades as rows accumulate.
Materialised views are the documented escalation path if the 2 s dashboard target
is missed at 100k rows.
*(ADR-004)*

**D0.6 — Reports read only `approved` production entries.**
Draft and submitted data never reaches a report or the ERP. This is what makes
the numbers trustworthy to management, and is why the approval workflow exists.

**D0.7 — Metric definitions fixed centrally.**
`docs/11-reporting-analytics.md` §1 is authoritative. Notably: achievement % is
`SUM(actual)/SUM(planned)`, aggregated *then* divided — never the average of
per-row percentages, which would weight a 10-unit line equally with a 1,000-unit
line. Phase 12 tests that dashboard, PDF and XLSX reconcile.

**D0.8 — Four roles, mapped to Odoo natively.**
Operator, Supervisor, Plant Manager as internal user tiers with cumulative
`implied_ids`; Customer as a portal user. Operator scope is derived from
`fmes.operator.allocation` for *today*, so access follows the roster with no
extra administration.

**D0.9 — ERP 10.8 seam built dormant in Phase 1.**
`fmes.erp.sync.mixin` (external id + sync state) and `fmes.sync.log` ship in
Phase 1 and stay unused. Retrofitting external identity onto live production
records later would be a manual data-matching exercise; reserving the columns now
costs nothing.
*(ADR-006)*

**D0.10 — Mock ERP data lives in `demo/`, never `data/`.**
A production install (`--without-demo=all`) must get none of it. Real master data
arrives by import instead.

**D0.11 — 15 phases, one requirement area each where possible.**
Gives a clean traceability story and a demonstrable increment per phase.
Dependency chain: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → {5, 8} → 6 → 7 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15.

**D0.12 — Commit identity is `sinchanakulkarni2112`, and authorship is human-only.**
Set **repo-locally** so this machine's other projects keep their own identity:

```
user.name  = sinchanakulkarni2112
user.email = 323928844+sinchanakulkarni2112@users.noreply.github.com
```

The `…@users.noreply.github.com` form is GitHub's privacy address for that
account (id `323928844`) — it attributes correctly on GitHub without publishing a
personal email in the history. No commit may be authored by `shreyassridhar44` /
`shreyassridhar146@gmail.com`; the two Phase 0 commits were rewritten with
`git rebase --root --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit --reset-author'` and
force-pushed. No AI author, co-author, trailer or footer anywhere. Recorded in
`CLAUDE.md` §1 and `AGENTS.md`, verified before every push.

### Open questions for later phases

**Moved to `docs/15-open-questions-and-assumptions.md`** — 40 questions in Part A
(ordered by the phase that needs them) and 48 assumptions in Part B.

**D0.13 — No phase ever blocks on an unanswered customer question.** Where an
answer is unknown we adopt the industry-standard default, give it an assumption
ID, and implement it as a **configuration record** rather than hard-coded logic.
When the real answer arrives it is a data edit by the Plant Manager — not a code
change, not a migration, not a redeploy.

*Why:* the customer's process discovery runs in parallel with the build. This is
how manufacturing software is normally delivered under that constraint, and it
means the build proceeds at full speed while remaining honest about what is a
guess. Every guess is traceable to the record that carries it.

The highest-value answers to chase, in order: **Q5** standard output rates (the
capacity matrix — nothing about automated planning is better than this input),
**Q8** a real DAY WISE OUTPUT sample, **Q3/Q4** the real machine and department
list, **Q36–Q40** the ERP questions (longest lead time), **Q32** SMTP access.

### Delivered in Phase 0

- `docs/00` – `docs/14` plus `docs/README.md` — the full design set
- `README.md` — clone-and-run instructions
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md` — working conventions
- Odoo 18 Community capability audit

### Next

**Phase 1 — Docker Foundation & Module Skeleton.** `docker-compose.yml`,
`config/odoo.conf`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, the `furnishing_mes` skeleton
with its manifest and the four security groups, the dormant ERP sync mixin, the
`Makefile`, and an install smoke test.

---

## Phase 1 — Docker Foundation & Module Skeleton
*Completed 2026-09-06 · module version `18.0.1.0.0`*

### Delivered

`docker-compose.yml` (web + db, healthcheck-gated), `config/odoo.conf`,
`.env.example`, `Makefile`, and the `furnishing_mes` module skeleton: manifest
with the full verified dependency list, the three internal security groups, an
empty ACL file, the ten-section menu tree with one working leaf, the dormant ERP
sync mixin, a generated module icon, an Apps description page, and 19 tests.

### Verified, not assumed

- Module state `installed`, version `18.0.1.0.0`
- `/web/login`, `/web/health` and the module icon all return HTTP 200
- Group hierarchy read back from the database:
  Operator -> Internal User · Supervisor -> Operator + MRP User + Equipment
  Manager · Plant Manager -> Supervisor + MRP Manager + Stock Manager
- 12 menu records created
- **19 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors**
- Clean install and upgrade at `--log-level=warn`

### Decisions

**D1.1 — The master password lives in `config/odoo.conf`, not `.env`.**
Verified against `odoo/tools/config.py` on the 18.0 branch: **there is no
`--admin-passwd` command-line option**. `admin_passwd` is a config-file setting
only, so it cannot be injected from the environment the way the database
credentials can.

Rather than ship a bootstrap script (which would break "clone and run") or leave
Odoo's silent default of `admin`, the development config carries an explicit
placeholder, `fmes_dev_master_change_in_production`, and the stack **binds to
127.0.0.1 by default**. That binding is what makes the placeholder harmless: the
database manager is not reachable from the network. `ODOO_BIND=0.0.0.0` in
`.env` opens it for tablet testing on a trusted network. Production generates a
strong value into a git-ignored config (Phase 15).

**D1.2 — `list_db = True` in development.** Follows from D1.1: the first-run
database wizard needs it, and the localhost binding contains the risk. The
security doc's hardening table now separates development from production
explicitly rather than stating one value for both.

**D1.3 — Makefile odoo targets use `docker compose run --rm`, never `exec`.**
Two failures found by actually running them:
- `exec` **bypasses the image entrypoint**, so the `HOST`/`USER`/`PASSWORD`
  variables are never turned into `--db_host`/`--db_user`/`--db_password`.
  Odoo then falls back to a local unix socket that does not exist:
  `connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed`.
- `exec` shares the running server's network namespace, so a second Odoo tries
  to bind port 8069: `Address already in use`.

`run --rm` starts a throwaway container through the entrypoint and publishes no
ports, so both problems disappear — and HTTP still works inside it, which the
`HttpCase` tours in later phases will need.

**D1.4 — The `PG*` libpq variables are set on the `web` service.**
`PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD` are read directly by psycopg2, so
even an `exec`'d Odoo reaches the database. This keeps every credential out of
the committed `config/odoo.conf` while making both invocation styles work.

**D1.5 — One real menu leaf ships in Phase 1.** Odoo hides a parent menu with no
visible children, so a pure skeleton would have been invisible after install.
Configuration -> Machines points at `mrp.workcenter`, which Phase 2 extends
anyway.

**D1.6 — The security-baseline test is written before it can fail.**
`test_every_fmes_model_has_an_acl` is trivially true today (no models yet), but
it will fail the moment a later phase adds a model without an
`ir.model.access.csv` row. Cheaper to write now than to remember later.

**D1.7 — Dependencies verified in a test, not just in a doc.**
`test_declared_dependencies_are_installed` asserts every declared dependency
exists and is installed, so accidentally depending on an Enterprise-only module
fails the suite rather than the customer's deployment.

**D1.8 — Container, volume and network names are not pinned.**
Found by cloning the repo to a second directory and running the documented
setup: because `container_name` and the volume `name:` keys were hardcoded, the
second clone attached to the first one's PostgreSQL data directory with a
different `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and died with
`password authentication failed for user "odoo"`.

Compose now prefixes everything with the project name, so two clones are
independent, and `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` gives full isolation. Nothing was lost
by removing the pins — every command in the docs goes through
`docker compose <service>`, never `docker exec <container-name>`.

Consequence for Phase 15: the backup script must reference
`${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-furnishing-mes}_fmes-web-data`, not `fmes-web-data`.
The deployment doc has been corrected.

### Environment notes for this machine

- Docker Desktop must be running; it was not, and had to be started.
- `docker` commands fail in Git Bash with
  `docker-credential-desktop: executable file not found` — Docker Desktop's
  `resources/bin` is not on Git Bash's PATH. **Run docker from PowerShell**, or
  add that directory to PATH.

### Next

**Phase 2 — Master Data & Capacity Matrix.** `fmes.shift`, the `mrp.workcenter`
extension with the maintenance-equipment bridge, `fmes.capacity.matrix`, the
downtime loss-reason taxonomy, sequences, the mock ERP dataset, and the customer
import templates.

---

## Phase 2 — Master Data & Capacity Matrix
*Completed 2026-09-06 - module version `18.0.2.0.0`*

### Delivered

`fmes.shift`, `fmes.capacity.matrix`, the `mrp.workcenter` machine-master
extension with the maintenance-equipment bridge, the downtime loss-reason
taxonomy, five document sequences, ACLs and multi-company record rules, six
Configuration menus, and a mock plant dataset. Plus CSV import templates in
`docs/templates/` so the customer can answer Q1-Q7 with a spreadsheet.

### Verified, not assumed

- 68 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors
- Fresh-database install and in-place upgrade both clean at `--log-level=warn`
- Demo data read back from the database: 15 machines, and **all 15 bridged to
  equipment consistently in both directions**
- All ten downtime categories classified after a fresh install; "Fully
  Productive Time" correctly left uncategorised

### Decisions

**D2.1 - A missing capacity rate resolves to 0.0, not to `default_capacity`.**
The data-model doc originally said to fall back to `workcenter.default_capacity`.
That field means "pieces produced in parallel", not an hourly rate. Substituting
it would produce plans that look right and are built on an unrelated number.
Returning zero makes the gap visible to the planner. Doc corrected; the
behaviour is unit-tested precisely because it is a deliberate choice that looks
like an omission.

**D2.2 - Odoo's own loss reasons cannot be classified declaratively.**
`mrp` ships `block_reason0..7` inside `<data noupdate="1">`, which sets
`ir.model.data.noupdate` on the records themselves. Odoo then skips *any* later
`<record>` aimed at them, whatever our own data block says — silently, with no
error. Three tests failed on this before it was understood.

The fix is a `<function>` tag calling
`_fmes_apply_default_categories()`, which runs on install and on every upgrade.
It only fills in reasons that are still unclassified, so a plant that
re-classifies one keeps its change.

*Generalisable:* to modify another module's data records, use a `<function>`,
never a `<record>` — unless you have confirmed that module declares them with
`noupdate="0"`.

**D2.3 - Python `@api.constrains` does not fire for fields absent from
`create()` values.** A capacity row created with neither product nor category
skipped `_check_target_defined` entirely, because Odoo only validates
constraints whose fields appear in the write. Two fixes applied: the constraint
now also lists `workcenter_id` (always present), and a SQL `CHECK` backs it up.
Odoo inserts before validating, so the SQL constraint is what actually catches
it — and Odoo still surfaces the friendly message declared beside it.

*Generalisable:* a cross-field "at least one of" rule needs a SQL constraint,
not just `@api.constrains`.

**D2.4 - `basis_hours` on the capacity matrix.** Plants quote rates per shift or
per day as often as per hour. Normalising to hours requires knowing what the
basis represents; hard-coding 8 or 7.5 would silently distort every rate quoted
that way. The field defaults per basis (1 / 7.5 / 22.5 from A1) and is editable.

**D2.5 - The equipment bridge is two mirrored Many2ones with a context guard.**
`mrp.workcenter.equipment_id` and `maintenance.equipment.workcenter_id` are kept
in step by `create`/`write` overrides that pass `fmes_bridge_sync=True` to stop
the two models writing to each other forever. A SQL `unique(equipment_id)`
prevents one equipment record serving two machines. This is gap G3 — what Odoo
Enterprise provides through `mrp_maintenance`.

**D2.6 - Demo data is generated, not hand-written.** A build-time script emits
the four demo XML files; only the XML is committed. Keeps 40 capacity rows and
30 order pairs internally consistent, and makes regenerating with the customer's
real shape a small edit.

### Gotchas found the hard way

- **XML comments may not contain `--`.** Both `--without-demo=all` and a
  `<!-- ---------- separator ---------- -->` broke the demo files. Validate XML
  before installing; the parser error points at the comment, not the cause.
- `_read_group` in Odoo 18 returns recordset keys, so `counts.get(record, 0)`
  is the correct lookup.

### Next

**Phase 3 - Production Planning Automation.** The planning engine, plan and plan
lines, the generator wizard, and the OWL scheduling board that replaces the
Enterprise Gantt.

---

## Phase 3 — Production Planning Automation
*Completed 2026-09-06 - module version `18.0.3.0.0`*

### Delivered

`fmes.production.plan` and `.plan.line`, the `fmes.planning.engine` service, the
generator wizard with a live demand-vs-capacity preview, the OWL scheduling
board that replaces the Enterprise Gantt, plan release onto manufacturing and
work orders, and an XLSX export. Routing operations were added to the demo bills
of materials so real work orders exist.

### Verified, not assumed

- **115 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors**
- End-to-end on the demo plant: 153 demands to 246 plan lines, 96.7% utilisation
  of the slots used, and **0 capacity breaches**
- Board SCSS and OWL component confirmed to compile into `web.assets_backend`
- XLSX route tested over HTTP, including the ZIP magic bytes
- Fresh-database install clean at `--log-level=warn`

### Decisions

**D3.1 - The engine is deterministic and explainable, not optimal.**
Greedy forward scheduling, earliest deadline first, with every tie broken on a
stated key so the result never depends on database ids. A planner coming off
spreadsheets needs to understand why a line landed where it did; an optimiser
that saves an hour at the cost of explainability is a poor trade here. Ordering
is unit-tested by generating twice and comparing signatures.

**D3.2 - Demand the engine cannot place is reported, never dropped.**
`plan.unscheduled_demand_note` names the order, the product, the quantity and
the reason. Silently shrinking demand to fit capacity is the single most
damaging thing a scheduler can do.

**D3.3 - Quantities are rounded so that hours always equal qty / rate +
changeover.** Found by a failing test: the engine sized hours from an unrounded
quantity while Odoo stored the quantity rounded, so the two disagreed in the
sixth decimal. A first clamp fix held the capacity line but broke the identity.
The right answer is to round the quantity *first* - down when filling a slot so
the hours still fit, exactly when the slot can absorb the remainder so no crumb
is left behind and falsely reported as unscheduled.

**D3.4 - Shift slots resolve in the company's timezone, not the user's.**
The first run scheduled a 06:00 shift to 04:00 UTC because the demo admin sits
in Europe/Brussels. A shift belongs to the plant: the same shift must resolve to
the same instant whoever generates the plan, or a manager working remotely
schedules the shop floor into different hours than the supervisor standing in
it. Unit-tested with two users in different timezones.

**D3.5 - The manpower factor is a real hook returning 1.0 until Phase 8.**
It is applied in `_slot_capacity_hours` like any other factor, but there is no
roster to read yet. Building a half-real constraint against a model that does
not exist would be worse than an honest placeholder. Phase 8 replaces one method
body; nothing else in the engine changes. The test asserts the documented
behaviour so the placeholder cannot be forgotten.

**D3.6 - Availability derates from real downtime history.** Planning every
machine at 100% availability is the commonest reason plans cannot be met, so the
engine reads the last 90 days of unplanned stoppages, excluding planned ones. It
returns 1.0 while there is no history, which is the case until Phase 5, and
never derates below 0.5 - a machine that broke down constantly last quarter is a
maintenance problem, not a reason to plan it at near-zero.

**D3.7 - Moving a line on the board re-sizes it against the target machine.**
The same quantity takes a different time on a different machine, and the setup
cost belongs to the machine being moved *to*. The server refuses a move that
would overload the target and says by how much; a board that lets a planner
build an impossible plan is worse than no board.

**D3.8 - Routing operations added to the demo BOMs.** Without them an order has
no work orders, so there is no machine-wise schedule to build and nothing for
the Phase 4 terminal to show. `mrp.production.workorder_ids` is a stored
compute, so Odoo creates them automatically on record creation - no confirm step
needed in demo data.

### Gotchas found the hard way

- **A test fixture can quietly invalidate its own premise.** The "unrated"
  product sat under a category whose *parent* carried a rate, so it resolved
  fine and the test asserting it could not be planned failed. It now has its own
  category tree.
- **`docker compose exec` cannot pipe a script from PowerShell** without a BOM
  being prepended, which Python rejects as `U+FEFF`. Pipe from Bash instead.

### Next

**Phase 4 - Daily Tracking & Shop-Floor Terminal.** `fmes.production.entry`, the
OWL tablet terminal, the supervisor approval queue, planned-versus-actual views,
and the DAY WISE OUTPUT importer.

---

## Phase 4 — Daily Tracking & Shop-Floor Terminal
*Completed 2026-09-06/07 - module version `18.0.4.0.0`*

### Delivered

`fmes.production.entry` (draft -> submitted -> approved), `fmes.import.batch`,
the operator machine-scoping fields on `res.users`, live machine status on
`mrp.workcenter`, the OWL shop-floor terminal with its `/fmes/terminal/*`
JSON-RPC endpoints, the DAY WISE OUTPUT importer wizard (configurable column
mapping, guessed from headers), the approval queue, planned-vs-actual views,
and the daily entry-generation cron.

### Verified, not assumed

- **169 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors**
- Fresh-database install clean at `--log-level=warn`
- End-to-end on the demo plant: plan released (246 lines) -> 82 entries
  generated from it (second generation run produced 0 - confirmed idempotent)
  -> output recorded -> submitted and approved -> 61 plan lines `done`, 21
  `partial` -> the 203.77-unit shortfall carried into the next plan -> a write
  to an approved entry's `actual_qty` raised `AccessError`
- Backend CSS bundle compiles with both `fmes-board` and `fmes-terminal` rules
  present (see D4.5 below - it did NOT compile on the first attempt)

### Decisions

**D4.1 - Only `state='approved'` entries may ever feed a report or KPI.**
Everything downstream (Phase 6 onward) must filter on this. Restated here
because it is the single rule Requirement 3.4 and the "no restating history"
guarantee both depend on, and getting it wrong once poisons every later phase
silently.

**D4.2 - The state lock closes the direct-write hole, not just the UI.**
`write()` blocks `state='approved'` unless the caller is a supervisor/manager
or `self.env.su`. Discovered by testing: a plain `search().write({'state':
'approved'})` bypasses `action_approve()` and every check inside it, and Odoo's
record rules do not catch this on their own -- they evaluate against the record
as it currently is, not as the write would make it. The superuser exemption
(`self.env.su`) is required too, or crons and data loads (including this
project's own tests) fail approving anything, which is a bug, not security.

**D4.3 - Approval writes actual output back onto the plan line
(`_sync_plan_line`), closing the loop opened in Phase 3.** Only *approved*
entries move `qty_done`; submitted-but-unapproved output does not touch the
plan. Reopening an approved entry (Plant Manager only) rolls the plan line back
to `pending`/`partial`, so the state machines for entry and plan line can never
drift out of step with each other. This is what makes the shortfall carry
forward automatically in Phase 3's engine without either model needing to know
about the other's internals.

**D4.4 - Every `/fmes/terminal/*` route re-derives the caller's rights from the
server, never trusts what the client sent.** The terminal runs on a shared
tablet -- the least trustworthy client in the building. `_check_workcenter`
re-validates the machine id against `_allowed_workcenter_ids` on every call;
`record()` accepts only an explicit whitelist of fields (`actual_qty`,
`rejected_qty`, `run_hours`, `downtime_hours`, `actual_manpower`, `note`) and
silently drops anything else in the payload, so a crafted request setting
`state` or `planned_qty` has no effect. Unit-tested by sending exactly that
payload and asserting nothing outside the whitelist moved.

**D4.5 - `sudo()` only after the machine is already authorised, and only for
what an operator has no rights on.** Live machine status reads
`mrp.workorder`/`maintenance.request`, which operators cannot see directly.
`_check_workcenter()` runs first and raises if the machine is not theirs;
`sudo()` is called only on a machine that has already passed that gate. This is
the "assert ownership before `sudo()`" rule from the security doc, applied for
real rather than as a principle.

**D4.6 - `min(420px, 100%)` in SCSS broke the entire backend asset bundle, not
just the terminal.** Sass claims `min()` as its own function and refuses to mix
`px` with `%`, so the whole `web.assets_backend` compile failed -- which would
have taken Odoo's own UI styling down with it, not merely left the terminal
unstyled. Found only by forcing a bundle rebuild and reading the compile
traceback; the earlier "does `fmes-terminal` appear in the CSS" check had
silently passed on a stale cached bundle. Fixed with explicit `width: 420px;
max-width: 100%;`. `minmax()` inside `repeat()` is unaffected -- Sass does not
intercept CSS Grid's own `minmax`.

*Generalisable:* never trust "is my string present in the compiled bundle" as a
green signal without first clearing cached `ir.attachment` asset records -- a
compile failure can leave the previous good bundle serving silently. Also:
CSS's own `min()`/`max()`/`clamp()` are unsafe to write literally in an Odoo
SCSS file: use two declarations (`width` + `max-width`) instead.

**D4.7 - The DAY WISE OUTPUT importer is built to a configurable, guessed
column mapping -- never a fixed layout.** The real file (question Q8) is still
unseen. Header titles are matched against keyword hints (`_guess_mapping`) to
pre-fill the mapping form, which the user can still override before
previewing. When the real file arrives, onboarding it is a mapping choice, not
a rework. Every import is a reversible `fmes.import.batch`; reverting is
refused if any of its entries were approved, so a bad import cannot be used to
quietly erase signed-off history via the back door.

**D4.8 - Operator machine scoping uses a real, permanent assignment
(`res.users.fmes_workcenter_ids` / `fmes_department_ids`), not a placeholder.**
`fmes.operator.allocation` (the *daily* roster) arrives in Phase 8, but a
permanent "this person normally runs these machines" assignment and a "today
this person is on this machine" allocation are genuinely different pieces of
information, and both are useful once the roster exists. An operator with no
assignment is not locked out (the terminal would be useless on day one) but is
scoped down to seeing only entries they created themselves -- never the whole
plant by default.

**D4.9 (assumption revision, A16) - No per-operator PIN; individual Odoo
logins instead.** The Phase 0 assumption proposed a shared machine session with
a PIN. Building it in Phase 4 without deciding this would mean guessing a whole
second authentication mechanism. Individual logins are simpler, give
`create_uid`/`submitted_by` real meaning for the audit trail, and Odoo's own
login is fast enough on a saved/kiosk browser that the "40 logins a shift"
friction the PIN was meant to avoid does not really apply. Recorded in
`docs/15-open-questions-and-assumptions.md`; a PIN can still be layered on top
later without changing the terminal if the plant insists on shared-tablet
handover (question Q12 downgraded from Medium to Low impact).

### Next

**Phase 5 - Downtime Management.** Extends `mrp.workcenter.productivity`
(already scaffolded in Phase 2's `fmes_category` field) with a shift/entry
link, an approval workflow mirroring the production entry's, and replaces
`fmes.production.entry.downtime_hours` -- currently a single typed number --
with the sum of coded downtime events, so every lost hour finally carries a
reason. Auto-escalation to `maintenance.request` for reasons flagged
`fmes_requires_maintenance` (already seeded in Phase 2) is the other half of
this phase.

---

## Phase 5 — Downtime Management
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.5.0.0`*

### Delivered

`mrp.workcenter.productivity` extended with the shift/entry link, plant
category, remarks, reporter, a draft/approved/rejected workflow and the
maintenance-escalation link; the reason-picker-and-running-timer downtime flow
in the shop-floor terminal, replacing Phase 4's plain typed-hours field; the
supervisor downtime approval queue; auto-escalation to `maintenance.request`
at creation time (not approval time - a broken machine needs attention now);
`fmes.downtime.report`, the SQL view backing loss analysis; and the seeded
default maintenance team that a production install would otherwise lack.

### Verified, not assumed

- **216 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors**
- Clean install on three separate fresh databases: with demo data, and
  explicitly `--without-demo=all` (the real production path) - both zero
  warnings
- End-to-end on the demo plant: plan -> entries -> six coded downtime events
  (one auto-escalating) -> `downtime_hours` rolled up automatically -> entries
  and downtime both approved -> an approved event correctly refused further
  edits -> `fmes.downtime.report` showed 3.25 hours across the events after an
  explicit flush -> a rejected event, edited by the operator who logged it,
  correctly returned to draft
- Escalation confirmed working against a true zero-demo-data database, using
  the seeded "Machine Maintenance" team preferentially over an unrelated
  auto-created one

### Decisions

**D5.1 - Every `mrp.workcenter` silently inherited the company's Mon-Fri
business-hours calendar, which zeroed downtime duration outside those hours.**
The single most consequential bug this phase found. Odoo's native
`mrp.workcenter.productivity.duration` compute calls
`loss_id._convert_to_duration()`, which — for any non-productive/performance
loss type on a work center that HAS a `resource_calendar_id` — computes
duration from that calendar's scheduled working hours, not wall-clock elapsed
time. Every machine gets a calendar by default via `resource.mixin`. A plant
running three shifts is down for stretches of every 24 hours a Mon-Fri 8-5
calendar knows nothing about: a night-shift stoppage computed to exactly 0.0
minutes. Found by a duration test returning 0.0 for a real 45-minute
stoppage — not by inspection; nothing before Phase 5 ever read `duration`.

Fixed by defaulting `mrp.workcenter.resource_calendar_id` to empty in our own
extension. This module's capacity and availability model is `fmes.shift`
(Phase 3, D3.4) — never Odoo's resource calendar — so the field should never
have carried a value here at all. Affects every machine created since
Phase 2; a genuinely fresh install is what surfaces the fix, not an upgrade of
a live database (the ORM field default only applies at record creation).

*Generalisable:* a field carrying a default inherited from a mixin
(`resource.mixin`, here) can silently change the behaviour of a DIFFERENT
native computation (`_convert_to_duration`) that reads it, in a way that has
nothing to do with why the mixin was inherited in the first place. Check what
else a native field feeds before assuming an unused-looking default is inert.

**D5.2 - Field-level `groups=` blocks a write even to CLEAR a restricted field
to False.** The auto-revert-to-draft path (editing a rejected event returns it
to draft, D5.-adjacent design decision below) included the supervisor-only
`fmes_approved_by`/`fmes_approved_on` in the SAME vals dict as the operator's
own edit, just to null them out — and Odoo refuses the whole write regardless
of the value, because `groups=` is a field-existence check, not a value check.
Fixed by moving the stamp-or-clear of those two fields into a separate,
narrow `sudo()` write, decoupled entirely from the caller's own vals.

*Generalisable:* never let a supervisor-only field ride along in vals a
non-supervisor's own write constructs, even to null it — sudo() a dedicated
follow-up write for administrative metadata instead.

**D5.3 - Supervisors and managers were caught by the OPERATOR's own
restrictive record rules, because the role hierarchy is cumulative.** Phase
1's `implied_ids` design means a Supervisor IS, transitively, an Operator too
— real group membership, not just a permission superset. Odoo evaluates a
non-global `ir.rule` against every group a user belongs to, INCLUDING implied
ones. With no OTHER non-global rule on `mrp.workcenter.productivity` for
`group_fmes_supervisor` to OR against, the operator's restrictive domain
silently applied to supervisors and managers as well — surfaced as a Plant
Manager unable to even READ their own record while trying to reopen it.
`mrp.group_mrp_user`'s native ACL grants the base RWCD permission; it does
nothing to exempt anyone from an `ir.rule` domain, because ACLs and record
rules are different layers entirely.

Fixed with an explicit, unrestricted `[(1,'=',1)]` rule for
`group_fmes_supervisor` — the EXACT pattern Phase 4 already used for
`fmes.production.entry` (`fmes_entry_supervisor_rule`), just missed here on
the wrong assumption that the native ACL alone would be enough this time.

*Generalisable, and now a hard project rule:* **any model that gets an
operator-scoped RESTRICTIVE `ir.rule` must ALSO get an explicit unrestricted
rule for `group_fmes_supervisor` in the SAME commit**, precisely because of
the cumulative hierarchy. Audited the rest of the record rules file while
fixing this: `fmes.production.plan`/`.plan.line`/`fmes.capacity.matrix`/
`fmes.shift` all use ACL-level restriction (`perm_write=0` for operator), not
`ir.rule`-level, so they were never exposed to this trap. Only
`fmes.production.entry` (Phase 4, already correct) and
`mrp.workcenter.productivity` (Phase 5, now fixed) carry operator-restrictive
record rules.

**D5.4 - `@api.constrains` on a computed field is not reliable enough for a
caller to catch, once `mail.thread` tracking is in the mix.** Both
downtime-categorisation rules read `fmes_category`, a stored related field.
Discovered the hard way: a `/fmes/terminal/downtime/start` request correctly
caught its own `ValidationError` and returned `{'ok': False, 'error': ...}` —
confirmed by instrumented logging showing "CAUGHT" — and the test STILL saw an
uncaught exception. Fetching the raw HTTP response body (bypassing the test
helper's own interpretation) showed why: Odoo's HTTP layer flushes the
environment AFTER the controller returns, inside its own
`_transactioning`/`retrying` wrapper, entirely outside any try/except the
controller can write — and THAT flush re-triggers `mail.thread`'s own
`_compute_field_value` -> `_validate_fields()` for the tracked, computed
field, raising the SAME constraint a second time, this time with nothing
catching it. An explicit `event.flush_recordset()` inside the controller's
own try block was NOT sufficient on its own to fully drain whatever
mail.thread schedules — only `_check_one_open_event_per_machine`, which
depends on plain, uncomputed fields, fired reliably and synchronously the
whole time.

Fixed at the right layer — the MODEL, not the controller — by validating both
rules early and synchronously in `create()`/`write()`, reading the loss
reason's category DIRECTLY (`self.env['mrp.workcenter.productivity.loss'].
browse(loss_id).fmes_category`) rather than through the computed
`fmes_category` field. This needs no flush and cannot be deferred: it either
raises right there, in the caller's own call stack, or it does not raise at
all. The `@api.constrains` versions stay as a documented backstop.

*Generalisable, and the most important lesson of this phase:* **never rely on
`@api.constrains` alone for a rule a calling layer (especially a JSON-RPC
controller) must be able to catch reliably, once the constraint depends on a
COMPUTED field on a model with mail.thread tracking enabled.** Validate early,
in plain Python, in create()/write() itself, reading the underlying data
directly rather than through the compute. This generalises to ANY future
model built the same way (extend a core model, add mail.thread, add a
constrains on a related+stored field) — audit for this pattern before shipping
a controller that depends on catching it.

**D5.5 - `action_reject()`'s chatter note must be best-effort, never able to
undo an otherwise-successful rejection.** Found running the end-to-end script
with a demo user that had no email configured: `message_post()` requires a
sender email, and its `UserError` propagated out of `action_reject()` even
though the STATE CHANGE (the actual rejection) had already been written.
Wrapped in a narrow `try/except UserError: pass` — the note is an audit-trail
nicety, not something that should be able to block the action it is
documenting.

**D5.6 - Downtime correctly reduces OEE once productive time is logged, but
nothing in the system logs productive time yet — recorded as a Phase 6
prerequisite, not a Phase 5 gap.** Odoo's native OEE is
`productive_time / (productive_time + blocked_time)`, both sides read from
`mrp.workcenter.productivity`. Phase 5 (correctly, per its own scope) only
ever writes the LOSS side; `fmes.production.entry.run_hours` is a plain number
that has never been mirrored into a `loss_type='productive'` productivity
record. Consequence, confirmed on the demo plant: every machine's native OEE
currently reads 0.0%, however accurately its downtime is coded, because the
denominator's productive component is always zero. The Phase 5
"OEE consistency" test is deliberately narrower than this and still correct:
it proves our downtime extension does not BREAK native OEE once productive
time exists (by logging both sides itself, inside the test) — it never
claimed the system produces meaningful OEE unassisted before Phase 6 wires up
the productive side. Added explicitly to Phase 6's deliverable list in the
build plan so it is not rediscovered as a surprise.

### Gotchas found the hard way

- **A duration/timing bug can hide behind a passing test suite until the
  first test that actually reads the affected field.** `resource_calendar_id`
  had been silently wrong since Phase 2; nothing broke until Phase 5 read
  `duration` for the first time.
- **"Is my class name in the compiled CSS" is not a green signal on its own**
  (restated from Phase 4, D4.6) — and neither, it turns out, is "did my
  try/except log that it caught the exception": check the actual wire
  response when a test's OWN interpretation of a result is in question, not
  just whether your code path executed.
- **A quick shell reproduction that "just works" does not rule out a bug that
  only manifests through the real HTTP dispatch path.** The difference here
  was Odoo's own post-dispatch flush, which a shell session never triggers
  the same way. When a shell test and an HTTP test disagree on IDENTICAL
  application code, suspect the FRAMEWORK layer around the code, not the code
  itself, before adding more workarounds to the code.
- **`env.cr.flush()` before querying a `_auto=False` SQL-view report model**
  is needed whenever the query runs in the SAME transaction as an unflushed
  write — a raw SQL view sees only what has actually reached the table. Real
  HTTP usage never hits this (Odoo flushes and commits between every
  request), but a one-session debugging/demo script will, and a "0 rows"
  result from a report immediately after writing the data it should contain
  is the tell.

Phase 7 - Maintenance Management.

## Phase 6 — Machine Utilisation & OEE
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.6.0.0`*

### Delivered

`fmes.utilization.report`, the SQL view backing utilisation and OEE analysis
(date x shift x machine grain, FULL OUTER JOIN of approved production and
approved downtime); `fmes.utilization.service` — rolling 30-day utilisation
per machine, under-utilised detection (worst-first), bottleneck ranking
(highest-utilisation-first) and a deterministic `_suggest_bottlenecks()`
recompute; `mrp.workcenter.fmes_utilization_pct` / `fmes_is_under_utilized`
computed fields feeding the machine kanban card and list column; the
"Suggest Bottlenecks" bulk server action; and, per D5.6,
`_fmes_sync_productive_time()` — mirroring an approved entry's `run_hours`
into a `loss_type='productive'` `mrp.workcenter.productivity` record, which is
what finally lets native `mrp.workcenter.oee` read a non-zero value.

### Verified, not assumed

- **235 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors**
- Clean install on the dev database and a fresh `--without-demo=all`
  database, both zero warnings; module version confirmed `18.0.6.0.0` in
  `ir_module_module` on both
- End-to-end on the demo plant: a demo machine's native `oee` read `0.0`
  before this phase (D5.6's gap) - approving a production entry with
  `run_hours=3.0` against it mirrored the productive-time log and `oee`
  immediately read `100.0`; `fmes_utilization_pct` read `40.0` (3 of 7.5 net
  shift hours). `_suggest_bottlenecks()` run against the demo plant correctly
  CLEARED three machines that demo data had pre-flagged `fmes_is_bottleneck`
  by hand but whose current rolling utilisation no longer clears the 90%
  threshold - proof the recompute is a live function of current data, not a
  label that just gets carried forward.

### Decisions

**D6.1 - A raw SQL view (`_auto = False`) does not get the ORM's usual
auto-flush before `search()`, and a test can hit this even without a
hand-written debugging script.** MEMORY.md already carried this exact gotcha
from Phase 5's `fmes.downtime.report` — and it still cost a real, reproduced
test failure here: `TestUtilizationReportAccess.test_supervisor_can_read_the
_utilization_report` intermittently found zero rows, searching the view as a
different user immediately after approving the entry that should populate it.
A regular model's `search()` flushes the stored fields it depends on
automatically; `fmes.utilization.report`'s hand-written SQL has no such
dependency graph for the ORM to flush against, so `_fmes_sync_productive_time
()`'s own write (and the entry's own computed fields) could still be sitting
in the ORM cache, never having reached `fmes_production_entry` /
`mrp_workcenter_productivity` in Postgres, when the view's query ran.
Reproduced deterministically: running the single test method alone passed
(its own preceding code happened to flush incidentally); running it as part
of its class, after a sibling test, failed the same way every time — not
flaky, just genuinely missing a flush. Fixed by calling `self.env.flush_all()`
explicitly before every test in this phase that reads the view, including a
class-wide `setUp()` for the tests that read it indirectly through
`fmes.utilization.service`.

*Generalisable, restated because it was already written down once and still
got missed:* **any test that writes through the ORM and then reads a
`_auto=False` SQL view in the same transaction must call `self.env.flush_all
()` between the two, unconditionally** - a helper that already does this
(like this phase's own `_report_row()`) is not a substitute for auditing
every OTHER place in the same test file that touches the view a different
way (raw `search()`, or indirectly through a service method's `_read_group`).

**D6.2 - The view's own docstring claimed something the SQL didn't actually
do.** It said a downtime event logged with no linked production entry would
still surface as its own row, via the `FULL OUTER JOIN`. In fact
`mrp.workcenter.productivity.fmes_shift_id` is a *related* field off
`fmes_entry_id` (Phase 5) - an entry-less event has no shift to place it in,
and the view's SQL filters `p.fmes_shift_id IS NOT NULL` precisely because the
report's grain is date x SHIFT x machine. Caught on re-reading the docstring
against the SQL rather than by a failing test (nothing exercised the claim).
Corrected the comment to say what actually happens - that event still counts
toward the machine's own MTBF/MTTR once Phase 7 adds it - rather than leave a
documented behaviour the code does not provide.

*Generalisable:* a comment describing what a JOIN is "for" is a claim about
behaviour, not just intent - check it against the actual WHERE clause before
trusting it, especially on a view with a fixed grain that a general-purpose
join strategy does not automatically respect.

### Next

Phase 8 - Manpower & Resource Management.

## Phase 7 — Maintenance Management
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.7.0.0`*

### Delivered

`fmes.maintenance.schedule` (time-based or usage-based preventive templates,
never appearing on anyone's work queue directly) plus
`fmes.maintenance.checklist.line`; the `fmes_generate_preventive_requests`
cron, which raises a real `maintenance.request` `lead_time_days` ahead of
`next_due_date` and refuses to raise a second one while the first is still
open; usage-based triggering off accumulated approved productive hours
(`_check_usage_triggers`, assumption A51); the `maintenance.request`
extension (work center, origin schedule, a frozen `fmes_due_date` snapshot
for PM-compliance, the downtime link, cost, a snapshotted checklist result);
`maintenance.equipment.fmes_health_score` (assumption A50); and
`fmes.maintenance.report`, the month x equipment SQL view, with `mtbf`/`mttr`
layered on top as ordinary computes reading the native equipment fields
directly rather than reimplementing them.

### Verified, not assumed

- **268 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors**
- Clean install on the dev database and a fresh `--without-demo=all`
  database, both zero warnings; module version confirmed `18.0.7.0.0` in
  `ir_module_module` on both
- End-to-end on the demo plant: backdating a schedule's `last_done_date` put
  it inside its own lead-time window -> the cron raised exactly one
  preventive request -> a second cron run raised nothing further -> marking
  it done moved `last_done_date` forward and recomputed `next_due_date` a
  month out -> a breakdown logged against the same machine produced a
  corrective request carrying its work center and a live downtime figure
  (0.0h running, ~0.22h once stopped) -> the equipment's health score read
  92 (100 minus the 8-point penalty for that one recent breakdown) -> the
  KPI report showed 6 equipment/month rows, `mtbf`/`mttr` read straight off
  the native equipment fields.

### Decisions

**D7.1 - Native `maintenance.equipment` carries its own restrictive record
rule that our own ACL grant does not override.**
`maintenance/security/maintenance.xml`'s `equipment_rule_user` limits anyone
WITHOUT `maintenance.group_equipment_manager` to equipment they personally
follow (a mail.thread follower, via `message_partner_ids`) — supervisors and
managers are exempt because `group_fmes_supervisor` implies
`group_equipment_manager` (Phase 1), but operators are not. Our own
`ir.model.access.csv` grants operators plain read on `maintenance.equipment`,
which made it look safe to read `equipment.mtbf` / `.expected_mtbf` directly
in the health-score compute — a test proving an operator could read the
score on a machine they do not follow failed with a genuine `AccessError`,
the ACL and the record rule being two different, independently-enforced
layers (the same class of gap D5.3 found on our OWN rules, this time on a
NATIVE one). Fixed by reading `mtbf`, `expected_mtbf`, `fmes_schedule_ids`
and `maintenance_ids` through `equipment.sudo()` inside the compute — the
score is a read-only 0-100 summary, not the underlying rows, so it should
not depend on who happens to follow this specific equipment record.

Left alone, out of this phase's scope: `mrp.workcenter._compute_fmes_current
_state` (Phase 2/4) searches `maintenance.request` the same non-sudo way to
decide whether a machine shows as "under maintenance," and is likely exposed
to the identical gap for an operator with no personal history on that
request — worth revisiting whenever operator-facing machine status is
touched again (Phase 11's alert work is the natural point).

**D7.2 - Native `maintenance.request.write()` re-stamps `close_date` to the
real "today" whenever `stage_id` is in the same vals dict, silently
overriding any explicit `close_date` passed alongside it.** Found by a
PM-compliance test that backdated a request's close date to prove an
on-time closure — it passed on the first attempt, but for the wrong reason:
the real test-run date happened to still read as "late" against the fixed
due date used, coincidentally matching what the test expected. Re-ordering
the assertion (proving the ON-TIME case, where the coincidence broke) is
what surfaced it. Fixed with a second, separate `write({'close_date': ...})`
call after the stage-changing one — the same "two writes, deliberately"
shape Phase 5 already uses for `fmes_approved_by`/`_on` (D5.2).

*Generalisable:* when native code re-derives a field as a SIDE EFFECT of a
write (not just defends it), passing your own value for that field in the
SAME vals dict is not reliable — a separate follow-up write is the only way
to know which one wins.

**D7.3 - The month x equipment grain needed its own frozen due-date, not
just the schedule's live `next_due_date`.** `fmes.maintenance.schedule.
next_due_date` moves forward the moment a cycle completes, so by the time
anyone looks BACK at a historical request to judge "was it closed on time,"
the schedule's own field no longer reflects what was due for THAT specific
visit. Added `maintenance.request.fmes_due_date` — not in the original
Phase 0 field list, but the same reasoning Phase 4/5 apply to an approved
entry's own frozen figures — a snapshot taken once, at generation, never
touched again. `fmes.maintenance.report` also needed its own `has_pm_due`
boolean, the same null-handling pattern `has_target` established in Phase 4:
a month with no PM due for a machine reads as "—", not a misleading 0%.

### Next

Phase 8 - Manpower & Resource Management.

---

## Phase 8 — Manpower & Resource Management
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.8.0.0`*

### Delivered

`fmes.manpower.log` (standard vs actual headcount, absence, overtime,
shortage/shortage_pct/utilization_pct — the same sum-then-divide standard-
vs-actual maths as everywhere else, D0.7) and `fmes.operator.allocation`
(the daily roster, unique per employee/shift/day, with a "Copy to Next Week"
bulk action); `res.users.fmes_allowed_workcenter_ids` now reads today's
roster FIRST, falling back to the permanent assignment and then the
department-wide default in that order; `fmes.planning.engine.
_get_manpower_factor` replaced its Phase-3 placeholder with a real
roster-vs-standard derating, floored the same way `_get_availability_factor`
already is; and `fmes.manpower.impact.report`, the date x shift x department
view putting shortage % and achievement % side by side.

### Verified, not assumed

- **297 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors**
- Clean install on the dev database and a fresh `--without-demo=all`
  database, both zero warnings; module version confirmed `18.0.8.0.0` in
  `ir_module_module` on both
- End-to-end on the demo plant: Panel Saw 01 fully staffed today (2 of its
  standard 2) read a manpower factor of `1.0`; rostering only one of the two
  for tomorrow dropped it to `0.5` — and generating tomorrow's plan actually
  used it, landing the saw's line at `3.75` planned hours, exactly half its
  normal 7.5-hour capacity, not just an isolated factor calculation. An
  operator linked to that roster read zero allowed machines before being
  rostered and exactly the rostered machine once added.

### Decisions

**D8.1 - Assumption `A49` had already been used once, and Phase 6 silently
duplicated it.** `A49` originally named the exact placeholder this phase
resolves (`_get_manpower_factor` returning a flat `1.0` "until Phase 8").
Phase 6 assigned `A49` a SECOND time, to the unrelated bottleneck-suggestion
threshold, without the collision being noticed — the check at the time was a
`grep` for the ID pattern piped through `sort -u`, which DOES dedupe
identical strings but does not flag two DIFFERENT rows that happen to share
an ID; the two entries sat far enough apart in an eighty-plus-row document
that a visual scan of the sorted list missed it too. Found only because this
phase needed to read the ORIGINAL `A49` and discovered a second row under
the same heading. Fixed by renumbering the Phase 6 entry to `A52` (the next
free id) and leaving the original in place, since resolving it is literally
what this phase does.

*Generalisable:* **grep the exact assumption ID string before assigning a
new one** (`grep -n 'A49' docs/15-...md`), not just a sorted listing of all
IDs — a sorted list surfaces gaps, not collisions, and a collision is the
more dangerous of the two (two DIFFERENT things silently sharing one
citation, rather than a missing one).

**D8.2 - Department-scoped supervisor rules, promised since Phase 1, needed
a genuine Python conditional in `domain_force`, not a domain clause.**
`res.users.fmes_department_ids`'s own help text has always said "leave empty
for all" — so the rule cannot be a static domain; it has to read as "if this
user's own department list is empty, see everything, else restrict to it."
Written as `[(...)] if user.fmes_department_ids else [(1,'=',1)]` — a full
Python conditional EXPRESSION evaluating to one of two domain lists, which
`ir.rule.domain_force`'s own `safe_eval` supports and is a more readable
answer than trying to fold the same logic into a single OR'd domain. The
same D5.3 cumulative-hierarchy pattern applies one level up here too: without
an explicit unrestricted rule for `group_fmes_manager` on both new models, a
Plant Manager with no personal `fmes_department_ids` set would be caught by
the supervisor's own department-scoped rule, exactly the way an unscoped
Supervisor rule once caught Operators. Scoped to this phase's own two new
models only — retrofitting the same pattern onto `fmes.production.entry`,
`mrp.workcenter.productivity` and the plan/plan-line pair is real, useful
work, but a separate exercise, not something to fold into this commit
unannounced.

**D8.3 - Two Odoo-18-specific view/field validation errors, both caught by
the install itself.** `tracking=True` is not a valid parameter on a
`Selection` field on a model that does not inherit `mail.thread` — Odoo
warns rather than fails, but it is dead configuration, so it was removed
rather than left as noise (`fmes.operator.allocation` has no chatter).
`quick_add` is not a valid attribute on `<calendar>` in Odoo 18's view
schema — this one DOES fail the install (a RelaxNG validation error), caught
immediately on the first `-u` run.

Phase 10 - Analytics & Dashboards.

## Phase 9 — Backlog & Carry-Forward
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.9.0.0`*

### Delivered

`mrp.production` extended with `fmes_block_reason`/`fmes_block_note` (a
supervisor-only, field-level-gated pair) and a computed `fmes_is_blocked`,
which `_demands_for_production` now checks first and excludes entirely;
`fmes.backlog.snapshot`, a plain (non-computed) stored model written once a
night by `fmes.backlog.service` from two sources — every open `mrp.
production` and any confirmed sale-order line not yet covered by one,
mirroring the exact same "covered" dedup `_collect_sale_order_demand`
already used; and `fmes.planning.engine._cron_generate_carry_forward_plan`,
a thin, idempotent nightly wrapper around the carry-forward `generate()`
already built in Phase 3.

### Verified, not assumed

- **327 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors**
- Clean install on the dev database and a fresh `--without-demo=all`
  database, both zero warnings; module version confirmed `18.0.9.0.0` in
  `ir_module_module` on both
- End-to-end on the demo plant: three fresh orders (on-track, two days late,
  and one marked blocked) each produced exactly one snapshot row on the
  first cron run, and re-running it immediately after left the row count
  unchanged. The blocked order's own demand came back genuinely empty from
  the planning engine, not just labelled blocked in a report. The
  carry-forward cron created tomorrow's plan on first call and returned the
  *same* plan object on a second call rather than a duplicate.

### Decisions

**D9.1 - Carry-forward itself was not new work here — only something to
call it automatically was missing.** `generate()` has rolled unfinished
released plan lines into whatever plan it builds since Phase 3
(`_collect_carry_forward`, `source='carry_forward'`), already tested there.
Phase 9's own cron is a thin wrapper: skip if an auto-generated plan already
covers tomorrow, else call `generate()` for it. Worth stating plainly
because it would be easy to mistake this phase for having reimplemented
carry-forward, when the actual gap being closed was purely "nobody was
calling this automatically yet."

**D9.2 - Assumption A32's two criticality clauses ("> 15 days aged, or an
order > 7 days past deadline") are genuinely two different measures, not
one restated twice, and only one of them is a live field.** Read against a
single "age" concept the two clauses collapse into one (deadline-lateness
would always fire the tighter 7-day threshold first, making 15 days
unreachable). Implemented as intended: "aged in the backlog" is tracked
independently of the order's own deadline, by looking up each production
order's OWN earliest snapshot_date across all its prior nightly rows — a
large order sitting unstarted for weeks now flags as critical even while its
deadline is still comfortably in the future, which is the entire point of a
SECOND criterion existing at all. Only meaningful for production-order-backed
rows, which carry a stable `production_id` to key the lookup on; a
sale-order-line row with no manufacturing order yet has no such key, so its
own criticality is judged on lateness alone — a documented, deliberate
narrowing, not an oversight.

**D9.3 - Every derived field on `fmes.backlog.snapshot` is a plain field,
never `@api.depends`, and this needed saying explicitly in the model's own
docstring.** Every other read model in this project (utilization, downtime,
maintenance, manpower-impact reports) computes its figures live, by design —
they are windows onto CURRENT data. A backlog snapshot is the opposite: its
entire purpose is being a trustworthy PAST record. A live compute reading
`fields.Date.context_today()` would silently rewrite a two-week-old row's own
`days_delayed` every time anyone opened it after today moved on, which would
make the word "history" in this model's own description a lie. Written up
explicitly because "this compute should obviously be live" is the reflex
this whole codebase has trained, correctly, in every OTHER report — this is
the one deliberate exception, not a rule ready to imitate elsewhere.

**D9.4 - `__count` is not a declarable field in a pivot/graph view.** Odoo
adds it as an available measure automatically; writing `<field name=
"__count" type="measure"/>` in the arch fails view validation outright
("Field `__count` does not exist in model..."), caught on the very first
install attempt rather than by inspection.

**D9.5 - A structural bug in this file, found and fixed while writing this
entry: Phase 8's own section had been spliced in BEFORE Phase 7's, not
after, breaking the chronological order every earlier phase relied on.**
Traced to the Phase 8 session locating its insertion point by matching the
literal text of the `### Next` stub rather than confirming which phase's
content it actually followed — the stub it found still read "Phase 8" but
was sitting after Phase 6, not after Phase 7, because Phase 7's OWN
`### Next` stub had been consumed without a fresh one being left in its
place. Fixed here by moving Phase 8's entire section to after Phase 7's and
restoring a proper stub chain. *Generalisable: when replacing a `### Next`
stub, verify by section HEADER what precedes it, not just that the stub
text names the expected next phase — a stub can be textually correct and
still be sitting in the wrong place.*

Phase 11 - Alerts & Notifications.

## Phase 10 — Analytics & Dashboards
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.10.0.0`*

### Delivered

`fmes.production.report` — the last of the four `_auto=False` read models,
grain date x shift x machine x product, the SAME sum-then-divide discipline
(D0.7) as the other three; `fmes.dashboard.service`, one Python method per
tile, computing all ten requested metrics (KPI row, production trend,
downtime Pareto, department/shift performance, machine utilisation ranking,
capacity utilisation, backlog ageing, maintenance performance, productivity
trend) as plain server-side aggregation; the Executive Dashboard itself, an
OWL client action (`static/src/js/executive_dashboard.js`) rendering
Chart.js charts over that data, one component serving both role variants
(a Plant Manager sees the plant-wide figures, a Supervisor's own
`fmes_department_ids` is pre-selected on load); and `fmes.utilization.report`
gained one more exposed column, `ok_qty`, needed to make a multi-row OEE
aggregation possible at all.

**Not delivered, deliberately: `spreadsheet_dashboard` boards** (deliverable
5). A board's content is a raw o-spreadsheet JSON document — a real example
from Odoo's own `spreadsheet_dashboard_sale` module ran to ~78 KB of cell
grids, styles, chart figures anchored by pixel coordinates and pivot
definitions with per-field-type matching. Hand-authoring one reliably
without the actual Spreadsheet editor UI to generate it was judged too
fragile a use of the remaining effort in an already large phase. What
deliverable 4 (pivot/graph views on every report model) plus the Executive
Dashboard itself already cover satisfies the underlying "ad-hoc analysis"
need; a real board remains buildable later, directly from any of those
pivot views through Odoo's own Spreadsheet app, once real production data
exists to build it against.

### Verified, not assumed

- **347 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors**
- Clean install on the dev database and a fresh `--without-demo=all`
  database, both zero warnings; module version confirmed `18.0.10.0.0` in
  `ir_module_module` on both
- Deliverable 7 (every KPI equals a hand-aggregation of the same underlying
  rows): checked directly via `odoo shell` against real approved production
  data, both before and after the performance rewrite below, to confirm the
  optimisation changed nothing about what the numbers say
- Deliverable 6 (100k-row performance): measured server-side aggregation at
  **1.83 s** against a genuinely relevant 100,000-row dataset (every row
  inside the query's own date window, not mostly filtered out by it) — see
  D10.1
- **Not independently verified: the actual browser render.** No browser
  tool was available in this environment. Verified instead: XML template
  well-formedness, JS syntax (`node --check`), and the exact OWL/QWeb
  patterns matched line-for-line against Odoo's own native
  `graph_renderer.js` and this project's own Phase 3/4 OWL components. This
  is the one thing about this phase that is not fully confirmed.

### Decisions

**D10.1 - The first version of the dashboard service missed its own
performance target by 3x, and the fix mattered more than the maths.**
Measured 6.13 s against the 100k-row dataset before optimisation, against a
2 s budget. Root cause: `fmes.production.report` and `fmes.utilization.
report` are SQL views (`_auto = False`) — every separate query against one
re-runs its OWN join and group-by over the full underlying table from
scratch, and the first version queried each view independently once per
TILE that needed it (five or six separate hits, each redoing the same
expensive join). The KPI row alone cost 2.46 s just from calling `_kpi_raw`
twice (current and previous period), each doing two full view re-scans.
Fixed by fetching each view exactly ONCE per request
(`_fetch_production_rows` / `_fetch_utilization_rows`), at the finest grain
ANY tile needs (date x shift x machine — one level coarser than production's
own date x shift x machine x product grain, which no tile actually needs),
and having every tile derive its own further aggregation from that same
in-memory list in plain Python instead of hitting the database again.

*Generalisable:* **a SQL view has no memory between queries** — the same
correctness discipline that says "aggregate once, sum-then-divide" (D0.7)
does not by itself guarantee performance once a view sits underneath the
aggregation; five independently-correct queries against the same view can
still be five times slower than one. Fetch a view once per request when
several tiles/figures need it, and derive the rest in memory. Caught by
literally measuring against a stated volume before calling the deliverable
done — the same rigor this project has applied to every phase's OWN exit
criteria, just applied here to a NUMBER instead of a boolean pass/fail.

**D10.2 - `_read_group` on a Date field requires an explicit granularity
suffix in Odoo 18.** `groupby=['date']` raises `ValueError: Granularity not
set on a date(time) field` immediately — `groupby=['date:day']` is required.
Caught on the very first real call, not by inspection; every earlier
report/service in this module happened to group by a Many2one or a plain
non-date field first, so this was never exercised until the dashboard's own
trend tiles needed to group by date directly.

**D10.3 - Two more KPI targets needed a default that no earlier phase had
set.** A utilisation target (85%) and a downtime target (≤ 10%), distinct
from the more conservative first-year OEE target (`A28`, 75%) — logged as
assumption `A54` rather than left as an unexplained module constant, the
same as every other business-judgment number in this codebase.

## Phase 11 — Alerts & Notifications
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.11.0.0`*

### Delivered

`fmes.alert.rule` (the one rule engine covering all seven alert types) and
`fmes.alert` (a raised alert — the same "photograph, not a live view"
pattern as `fmes.backlog.snapshot`, plain fields set once at creation rather
than `@api.depends`, so an old alert never silently reinterprets itself
against a moving "today"); `services/alert_engine.py`, evaluating threshold
rules on a 15-minute cron and event rules (breakdown, material shortage,
blocked order) via three `base.automation` records that hand off to the
SAME engine method (`_on_event`) the cron path never touches directly;
scope filtering (global / department / machine), a cooldown-plus-open-alert
dedup so one condition cannot storm, severity-gated dispatch (critical
sends immediately, everything else queues for the 08:00 flush), and a
30-minute unacknowledged-critical escalation to the Plant Manager
(assumption `A55`). Nine default rules across all seven types (two types
each get a pair of rules sharing one `alert_type`, since a single rule has
only one threshold+operator pair — that pair is how the design expresses an
"or" condition). One reusable, severity-styled `mail.template` rather than
seven near-identical files. Alert Center (list/kanban by severity,
acknowledge/resolve, systray unread counter) and Alert Rules (Plant Manager
only) — both native Odoo views, no separate frontend, matching every
earlier phase's UI approach.

### Verified, not assumed

- Clean install and upgrade, with and without demo data, on a genuinely
  fresh database each time (not just `-u` against a database that already
  had this phase's own, once-broken data — see D11.1)
- 374 tests module-wide (27 new for this phase), 0 failed, 0 errors
- The two event-based alert types, and the block-driven `critical_backlog`
  path, verified through the REAL `base.automation` firing path — a test
  writes the exact field a plant user would (`fmes_maintenance_request_id`,
  `fmes_category`, `fmes_block_reason`) and lets `base_automation` itself
  decide to call the engine, rather than calling `_on_event` directly. A
  wrong `model_id` or `filter_domain` in the XML would fail these tests.
- `odoo shell` end-to-end against the seeded dev database: all 9 rules
  present across all 7 types, the cron active on its 15-minute interval, all
  3 automations wired, the mail template and both UI actions resolvable,
  the Alert Center menu resolving to its action, `get_unread_count()`
  callable

### Decisions

**D11.1 - A real QWeb compiler bug, invisible to every syntax check that
ran before the actual test suite.** The mail template's severity-coloured
header band originally computed its background colour inline inside a
`t-attf-style` attribute — `background:#{{ 'dc3545' if object.severity ==
'critical' else (...) }}` — syntactically valid XML, valid Python, and it
passed `py_compile`, `xml.dom.minidom` well-formedness, and even a plain
module install without complaint. Odoo 18's `t-attf-*` attribute
interpolation compiler failed to compile the embedded ternary only at
RENDER time (`ValueError: Can not compile expression: ...`), because a
`mail.template`'s `body_html` is compiled lazily, the first time an email
actually renders — which did not happen until a real test
(`TestEventTriggers`) triggered a critical alert's immediate dispatch.
Fixed by moving the ternary into a `t-set`/`t-value` (full Python
expression evaluation, the officially correct place for conditional logic)
and referencing the pre-computed variable from `t-attf-style` as a bare
name, which is only ever a substitution, never a re-parsed expression.
*Generalisable:* a `mail.template`'s `body_html` is NOT verified by
`--stop-after-init`, XML well-formedness, or even a successful install —
only an actual send (or, in tests, a real critical-severity alert) compiles
it. Any future template with attribute-level conditional logic should
prefer `t-set`/`t-value` over an inline `t-attf-*` ternary from the start.

**D11.2 - `noupdate="1"` blocks a bug fix from reaching an already-seeded
database, by design, and that is a genuine verification hazard, not just a
production concern.** `data/alert_rules.xml` and `data/fmes_alert_mail_
template.xml` are correctly `noupdate="1"` (so a plant that tunes a
threshold or a template keeps its own edit across upgrades), but that also
means `docker compose run --rm web odoo -u furnishing_mes` against a dev
database that already had D11.1's broken template left the OLD, broken
record untouched — a second test run against the "fixed" codebase still
failed against the stale data. The authoritative verification for this
phase used a dropped-and-recreated dev database for the final test run,
matching what a genuinely fresh deployment would see. *Generalisable:*
after editing a `noupdate="1"` data file mid-phase, `-u` is not sufficient
to re-verify against it — drop and recreate, or `-i` fresh.

**D11.3 - Two test-fixture bugs, not engine bugs, both surfaced by the same
real test run.** `fmes.maintenance.schedule._compute_next_due_date` treats
`interval_number=0` as falsy and substitutes `1`
(`schedule.interval_number or 1`, an existing and CORRECT guard, not a
Phase 11 defect) — a first test-helper attempt at "a schedule due today"
via `interval_number=0` silently produced a schedule due tomorrow instead.
Fixed by varying `last_done_date` in the test fixture rather than
`interval_number` (always `1`), which cannot hit the falsy-zero branch.
Separately, two tests asserted an exact recipient set/count reachable
through `group_fmes_supervisor` — real, shared group state that the demo
dataset also adds its own members to, the exact demo-data coupling
`tests/common.py`'s own docstring says this suite must never have. Fixed by
asserting membership/coverage of the specific users under test rather than
the group's total size. *Generalisable:* a group's `.users` is live,
shared, demo-data-affected state — never assert its exact membership or
count in a test, only that specific users under test are (or are not) in
it.

**D11.4 - `docker compose exec` cannot run a one-off `odoo` command
alongside the already-running `web` service.** `exec` runs inside the SAME
container as the long-running server, which already holds port 8069, so
even `--no-http` still fails with `Address already in use` — the
Makefile's own `ODOO_RUN := docker compose run --rm web odoo` already
documents exactly why (`run` publishes no ports, so a fresh, throwaway
container never conflicts). Re-confirmed here after initially reaching for
`exec` out of habit; every verification command for this phase used `run
--rm` afterward.

**D11.5 - Git Bash's MSYS layer silently rewrites a bare `--test-tags
/furnishing_mes` into a Windows path**, producing `Invalid tag C:/Program
Files/Git/furnishing_mes` and a false "0 tests, 0 failed" pass rather than
an obvious error — worth remembering specifically because a 0-test run
LOOKS like a clean pass in the log's final summary line unless the
`Invalid tag` warning earlier in the same log is also read. Fixed by
prefixing the command with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`; documented in
`docs/07-development-setup.md`'s Windows troubleshooting table.

---

## Phase 12 — Reporting Suite
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.12.0.0`*

### Delivered

All ten required reports through ONE data service
(`services/report_service.py`'s `get_report_data`), ONE `ir.actions.report`
+ QWeb template, and ONE `xlsxwriter`-based writer — a new report type is a
new `_data_<type>` method returning the same uniform `{title, period_label,
filters_label, summary, columns, rows}` shape (plus `sections` for the
Monthly MIS composite), never a new template, the same "one reusable
artefact" choice Phase 11 made for its mail template applied at ten-report
scale. `fmes.report.wizard` (the common parameter screen: date range,
department, machine, shift, product, format) and `fmes.report.schedule`
(four seeded defaults per `A36`, driving an hourly cron that emails a
rendered attachment and raises a Plant-Manager activity on failure rather
than failing silently) are both thin callers of that same service, so a
PDF, an XLSX and a scheduled email of the same report parameters can never
quietly disagree. Backing data is entirely reused from earlier phases'
report models (`fmes.production.report`, `fmes.utilization.report`,
`fmes.downtime.report`, `fmes.maintenance.report`,
`fmes.manpower.impact.report`, `fmes.backlog.snapshot`,
`fmes.production.plan.line`) plus Phase 11's own `fmes.alert` for the
Exception Report — this phase added no new aggregation logic, only
presentation, reconciliation and delivery.

### Verified, not assumed

- Clean install and upgrade, with and without demo data, on genuinely fresh
  databases
- 400 tests module-wide (26 new for this phase), 0 failed, 0 errors
- Every one of the ten report types produces real, correct rows and summary
  figures against a small fixture plant (never the demo dataset — see
  D12.4), including the Monthly MIS composite's seven sections
- `production_output_summary`'s achievement % reconciles exactly with what
  `fmes.dashboard.service.get_dashboard_data` computes for the identical
  date range — both derive it the same sum-then-divide way from the same
  underlying rows (D0.7), so this assertion is a genuine cross-check, not a
  tautology
- The scheduled-report cron's real send path: a schedule with a configured
  recipient produces an actual `mail.mail` with an attachment and correctly
  advances `last_run`/`next_run`; one with no recipients is a documented,
  tested no-op rather than a failure; a forced exception raises a real
  activity on a Plant Manager user
- The exact QWeb template PDF rendering uses was exercised through
  `_render_qweb_pdf`'s own test-mode HTML fallback (not a forced PDF — see
  D12.5); a genuinely rendered PDF (27 KB, real `%PDF` bytes) was confirmed
  once by hand via `odoo shell` against the live, already-running `web`
  service

### Decisions

**D12.1 - `record._fields['<name>'].selection` is not reliably the plain
option list it looks like, for a `related=` Selection field read off a
model INSTANCE.** `fmes.alert.alert_type` (`related='rule_id.alert_type',
store=True`) returned a callable there instead of the `ALERT_TYPES` list
of tuples, and `dict()`-ing it raised `TypeError: 'function' object is not
iterable` — invisible to `py_compile` and to a plain install, only
surfacing when the Exception Report actually ran against a real alert row.
Fixed by importing `ALERT_TYPES` directly from `models/fmes_alert_rule.py`
(the field's OWN original definition) rather than introspecting a related
copy at runtime — the same "single source of truth" pattern already used
for this phase's own `REPORT_TYPES` list (imported by the wizard and the
schedule model alike, so the three can never drift). *Generalisable:*
resolve a Selection field's real options from where it was originally
declared, never from `record._fields[...].selection` on a related copy.

**D12.2 - `fmes.maintenance.report`'s view has no filter excluding
equipment that isn't plant machinery**, so an unfiltered Maintenance
Report pulled in the native `maintenance` module's own generic demo assets
(an HP Laptop, an Acer Laptop, a monitor) alongside real machines — 6 rows
where a machine-scoped test fixture expected 1. Not a Phase 7 defect (that
view's own SELECT was never wrong for what IT does), but a real gap at the
report layer, fixed there: `_data_maintenance` now requires
`workcenter_id != False`, matching what "Equipment > Month" actually means
for this plant's own Maintenance Report.

**D12.3 - `ir.actions.report.report_action()`'s own default silently
diverts an admin user to a "configure your document layout" onboarding
wizard** whenever the current company has no `external_report_layout_id`
set, returning a completely different action dict with no `report_name`
key at all — caught only because a test inspected the wizard's own
returned action rather than assuming `report_action()` always returns the
report. Fixed by calling `report_action(self, config=False)` — a Plant
Manager clicking Generate should never be redirected to a logo-setup
wizard regardless of whether the company has configured Enterprise-style
branding.

**D12.4 - The `maintenance` module's own demo data (D12.2) is exactly the
kind of pollution `tests/common.py`'s "never depend on demo data" rule
already exists to keep assertions honest about** — this phase's fixtures
build their own small plant, the same discipline every earlier phase's
tests already follow, rather than reading the demo dataset. Worth
recording as a concrete example of why that rule earns its keep, not just
an abstract principle.

**D12.5 - Forcing a real wkhtmltopdf render inside the CLI test runner
(`force_report_rendering=True` under `--test-enable`) reproducibly hangs
or times out, regardless of which report is rendered** — a genuine
environment/tooling limitation of this Docker/CLI combination, not a
defect in the templates or data. Root-caused by testing the SAME action
against the live, already-running `web` service via `odoo shell` instead
of the throwaway single-process test runner: it rendered a real 27 KB PDF
in under a second, with only a benign `ContentNotFoundError` warning for a
missing logo image. `_render_qweb_pdf` already provides an HTML fallback
under `test_enable` when `force_report_rendering` is NOT set — the
automated suite uses exactly that (still exercising the identical QWeb
template and `_get_report_values`/`get_report_data` pipeline, the same
class of bug D12.1 and Phase 11's own QWeb finding both demonstrate),
while a genuinely rendered PDF was confirmed once by hand.
*Generalisable:* never force a real wkhtmltopdf render from inside
`odoo -d ... --test-enable --stop-after-init`; verify actual PDF bytes
against a live, already-running server instead, the same way Phase 10 and
Phase 11 already substituted a manual check for something no browser was
available to verify visually.

---

## Phase 13 — Customer Portal
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.13.0.0`*

### Delivered

The Customer persona, built almost entirely as an EXTENSION of native
Odoo portal pages rather than a parallel one (ADR-001, taken further this
phase than any earlier one): `/my/orders` and its order detail page are
`sale`'s own, already fully partner-filtered — the only order-facing work
here is a "Production Progress" table QWeb-inherited into
`sale.sale_order_portal_content`, reading three new computed fields on
`sale.order.line` (produced qty, progress %, expected date) sourced from
`mrp.production.sale_line_id` (native `sale_mrp`). `fmes.support.ticket`
(docs/03 section 9.1 — Helpdesk is Enterprise-only) is the one genuinely
new model, with a `/my/tickets` portal surface (list, detail, reply via
native `portal.message_thread`) and internal handling views for
Supervisors/Plant Managers. Two demo portal users (child contacts of two
demo customers) and two demo tickets seed the customer experience;
`docs/04-security-model.md`'s own documented provisioning path (native
"Grant Portal Access" invite wizard) is the real, production way — the
demo users exist only so a reviewer can log in without running that flow.

### Verified, not assumed

- Clean install and upgrade, with and without demo data, on genuinely
  fresh databases
- 416 tests module-wide (16 new for this phase), 0 failed, 0 errors
- Both ORM-level (`check_access`) AND real HTTP (`HttpCase`) coverage for
  every ownership boundary — the HTTP layer is what actually caught D13.2
  (below), which an ORM-only test would have missed entirely, since the
  bug was in the SEQUENCE lookup a real portal-user request triggers, not
  in anything a superuser-run ORM test ever exercises
- A portal customer's own company ticket (raised under the company
  partner, not their own exact contact) is readable; another customer's
  ticket 303-redirects to `/my` rather than rendering; a portal login
  hitting `/odoo` never reaches the backend, only `/my`

### Decisions

**D13.1 - `sale_mrp` was an undeclared dependency, and only a genuinely
fresh install ever surfaces that.** `mrp.production.sale_line_id` (needed
by this phase's own portal record rule and by `sale.order.line`'s new
progress compute) is defined by `sale_mrp`, which auto-installs whenever
both `sale` and `mrp` are present — true in every database this module
had ever been tested against up to this point, so the gap stayed
completely invisible until a fresh `-i furnishing_mes` failed immediately
with `Invalid field mrp.production.sale_line_id` while parsing
`fmes_record_rules.xml`. Odoo only guarantees load-order for a module's
own DECLARED dependencies, never for another module's auto-install side
effects — `furnishing_mes` depended on `sale_management` and `mrp`, but
never declared `sale_mrp` itself, so nothing pinned it to load first.
Fixed by adding `sale_mrp` to `depends` explicitly. *Generalisable:*
depend explicitly on every module whose fields you read, even ones that
"always happen to be there" via another module's auto_install.

**D13.2 - Portal ownership is a company-wide concept in Odoo
(`commercial_partner_id` + `child_of`), never a literal `partner_id`
field match — found by the demo data itself, immediately.** A first
version of both new portal record rules (support ticket, manufacturing
order) used `[('partner_id', '=', user.partner_id.id)]`. The demo ticket
was seeded under the COMPANY partner; the demo portal login's own
`partner_id` is a CHILD CONTACT of that company — the literal match
denied the customer read access to their own company's own ticket, caught
on the very first `odoo shell` check after install, before any automated
test even ran. Fixed by copying `sale.order`'s own native portal rule
exactly: `[('partner_id', 'child_of', [user.commercial_partner_id.id])]`
— applied to both new `ir.rule` records AND to the portal controller's
own ticket-list/count domain, which would otherwise have quietly
disagreed with the record rule (same list of tickets must come back from
both, or the home-page tile count and the actual list would drift apart).
*Generalisable:* before writing a new portal ownership rule, read what
`sale.order`'s own native rule actually does — do not assume a plain
`partner_id` match is the right shape.

**D13.3 - A portal customer creating their own ticket has no access to
`ir.sequence`, and this only shows up under a REAL portal-user HTTP
request, never under an ORM test run as the test superuser.** `next_by_
code()` inside `fmes.support.ticket.create()` raised `AccessError` the
first time an actual `HttpCase` test authenticated as a genuine portal
user and POSTed to the new-ticket form — every earlier ORM-level check in
this phase (including `create()` called via `.with_user(portal_user)`
directly) had NOT caught it for a subtler reason: `with_user()` still ran
inside the SAME already-superuser-derived environment chain in a way that
happened to mask it in one earlier manual check, while the two automated
test failures (one ORM `.with_user()`, one real HTTP POST) both correctly
caught the real gap once actually run. Fixed with a narrowly-scoped
`.sudo()` on the sequence lookup alone, commented with why: assigning the
next ticket number is bookkeeping, not something that should depend on
who is creating the ticket. *Generalisable:* a portal-facing `create()`
that touches ANY internal-only infrastructure (sequences, but the same
would apply to internal-only config models) needs that specific call
sudo'd, deliberately and narrowly — never the whole method.

**D13.4 - `portal.chatter` does not exist in Odoo 18 Community; the
correct template is `portal.message_thread`.** Caught by grepping the
actual installed `portal` module source after an initial assumption
(based on the template's common informal name in community discussion)
turned out to reference a template that simply is not there. `message_
thread`'s own docstring explicitly says to drive it through
`_document_check_access` + `_get_page_view_values` rather than setting
its variables by hand — the ticket controller already did exactly that
for other reasons, so no rework was needed once the right template name
was used. *Generalisable:* verify a template id against the actual
installed source before writing an `inherit_id`/`t-call` against it,
never against a remembered or commonly-used name.

---

## Phase 14 — Security Hardening, Testing & QA
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.14.0.0`*

### Delivered

A genuine security audit, not a formality: every model in the Phase 4
permission matrix checked against what the ACL + record rules ACTUALLY
grant (not what the table says), using real `.with_user()` calls against
freshly-created role users, the same discipline `test_security.py` itself
now encodes permanently. `tests/test_security.py` (17 tests, T1-T7 and T10
from docs/04's own checklist, T8/T9 verified by config review instead —
see D14 below for why). `scripts/seed_load.py`, a bulk-SQL performance
dataset generator (100k/50k/40k/5k rows across the four heaviest tables).
Three genuinely new SQL constraints on two models that had none at all.
The Odoo image pinned by digest. A real, timed backup/restore drill. A
real, run `coverage.py` measurement. Every one of these produced at least
one genuine finding — this phase, more than any other, was defined by
what testing something for real turned up rather than by new features.

### Verified, not assumed

- 433 tests module-wide (17 new), 0 failed, 0 errors, on a genuinely
  fresh database, after fixing every regression the security-rule
  changes caused
- 87% coverage on `models/`+`services/` combined, measured with actual
  `coverage.py` instrumentation (`services/` alone ≈88.6%)
- A real 195,000-row dataset generated, its dashboard/report timings
  measured, and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` run against the slowest query to find
  the ACTUAL bottleneck rather than guess at one
- A real `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` cycle: row counts matched exactly, and a
  fresh Odoo process booted cleanly against the restored database
- The two RST warnings appearing in every install log traced to Odoo's
  own `mail` module description (confirmed by rendering it directly
  through `docutils`), not this module's — `furnishing_mes`'s own
  description renders with zero warnings

### Decisions

**D14.1 - The write rules for `fmes.production.entry` and `mrp.
workcenter.productivity` had NO workcenter scope at all — the single
most serious finding of this entire project's security work.** Only a
state check gated write access; any Operator could edit any OTHER
operator's draft entry on any machine, not just their own allocated
ones, despite the READ rule on the SAME two models getting this exactly
right (`create_uid = self OR workcenter_id in allowed`). Reproduced live
via `odoo shell` — an operator scoped to one machine successfully wrote
to a draft entry on a completely different one — before a single test
was written, the same "prove it live first" discipline this project has
used since Phase 7. Fixed by adding the identical OR-clause the read
rule already used: `create_uid = self` alone keeps an operator's own
CREATE always working even with zero machine scope configured (the
model's own documented default — a record's `create_uid` is
definitionally the creating user, independent of workcenter), while a
WRITE to someone else's entry is now genuinely workcenter-gated.
*Generalisable:* a read rule and a write rule on the same model are two
INDEPENDENT domains in Odoo — getting one right is no guarantee about
the other, and both need the same audit.

**D14.2 - `groups=` on a field restricts WRITE as well as READ, and this
phase's own new field-level restriction broke a real workflow the moment
the full regression suite ran.** Restricting `fmes.production_entry.
submitted_by`/`submitted_on` to Supervisor-and-above broke `action_
submit()` itself — an Operator's own submit action stamps those fields
with their OWN identity, and lost write access to do so. Fixed the same
way Phase 13's D13.3 fixed an analogous gap (a portal customer's ticket
creation needing `ir.sequence` access they do not have): a narrowly
scoped `sudo()` on just that one write, commented with why — stamping
the audit trail is bookkeeping the ACTION performs, not something that
should depend on the caller's own rights to the audit columns.
*Generalisable, and the single most reusable lesson from this phase:*
before adding `groups=` to any field, grep every `.write()`/`.create()`
call that touches it — a field-level read restriction is invisible until
something tries to WRITE it as a side effect of an action the restricted
role is otherwise fully entitled to perform.

**D14.3 - Two real under-permission gaps were found by direct `odoo
shell` testing, the same class of bug as Phase 7's own D7.1, on a
DIFFERENT access path each time.** An Operator had no ACL row at all for
`mrp.workcenter` (only `mrp.group_mrp_user`, starting at Supervisor,
carries native read) and was separately blocked from `maintenance.
equipment` by a native follower-only rule (D7.1 fixed the health-score
COMPUTE path for this same model; direct read access generally was
still blocked). Both would have silently broken real shop-floor usage —
an operator unable to see the machine list — without ever surfacing in
a test, since this module's entire test suite runs as an admin/superuser
by default unless a test explicitly calls `.with_user()`.
*Generalisable:* "no test failed" is not evidence an ACL gap does not
exist — only a test that runs `.with_user()` as the actual role in
question can catch one, and this project's own tests overwhelmingly do
not, by design (most tests are about business logic, not access
control) — which is exactly why this phase's dedicated audit mattered.

**D14.4 - The permission matrix's simplified CRUD notation does not
always match the underlying Odoo group hierarchy, and two such
mismatches were reviewed and DELIBERATELY accepted rather than forced
to match the table.** A Supervisor can delete `maintenance.equipment`
(matrix: RW) because `group_equipment_manager` — implied by Supervisor
since Phase 1, for good reason — natively carries RWCD; narrowing that
implication this late would cost Supervisor real capability for a
low-severity permission (deleting a plant asset record). An Operator can
write/delete their OWN `maintenance.request` rows (matrix: RC) because
the native "own requests" rule is attached to `base.group_user`
generically, with no clean way to narrow it for one MES role without
editing a native Odoo record — accepted since correcting a typo in a
breakdown report you just filed is ordinary, reasonable behaviour.
*Generalisable:* a permission-matrix table is a design INTENT, not
automatically the implementation — auditing means checking BOTH
directions (find what is under-permissioned AND find what is
over-permissioned relative to the table), and an over-permission is not
automatically a bug; it can be a reviewed, accepted trade-off from an
earlier phase's own group-hierarchy design, and the right response is
to document that reasoning, not to silently force conformance.

**D14.5 - The Executive Dashboard misses its own 2-second target at
realistic volume (5.0s measured), root-caused via `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to a
structural SQL-view limitation, not a missing index.** `fmes.production.
report`'s own `HashAggregate` runs at its full multi-dimension grain
across the ENTIRE underlying table before any outer date filter can
apply — Postgres does not push the predicate through the view boundary
— and this happens TWICE per dashboard load (current + previous period).
Base-table indexes were confirmed comprehensive FIRST, ruling out the
obvious fix. The pre-planned escalation (materialising the view,
literally named "Phase 14 escalation path" in docs/11 since Phase 10)
is the architecturally correct fix and was DELIBERATELY NOT implemented:
it trades this for staleness, and a large number of tests since Phase 4
depend on the view being live within the same transaction
(`env.flush_all()` then an immediate read, D6.1). A lower-risk
alternative (read the underlying tables directly in `dashboard_service.
py`, bypassing the view's own wasted fine-grained aggregation) is
recorded as the recommended next step, not attempted here given the
correctness risk of rewriting an already-shipped, KPI-critical component
under time pressure. *Generalisable:* finding and honestly documenting
a real performance gap — with its root cause nailed down precisely
enough that a future fix does not have to re-diagnose it — is itself a
legitimate, valuable outcome of a hardening phase, distinct from and not
inferior to actually closing the gap when closing it safely would need
more scope than the phase has room for.

**D14.6 - Tooling friction, not project code, cost most of this phase's
wall-clock time.** `coverage.py` needed three separate fixes to run to
completion in this Windows/Git-Bash/Docker environment: PEP 668's
externally-managed-environment block (`pip install --break-system-
packages`), the default `.coverage` file landing somewhere the
container's own user cannot write (`COVERAGE_FILE=/tmp/.coverage`), and
Git Bash's MSYS layer mangling that SAME path when passed as a Docker
`-e` value — confirming Phase 12's own `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` fix applies
to environment-variable values too, not only positional CLI arguments.
Separately, `scripts/seed_load.py` needed two real fixes only a full run
against the real schema surfaced: PostgreSQL rejects `float || 'text'`
concatenation (fixed with `make_interval(secs => %s)`), and `maintenance_
request.kanban_state` is `NOT NULL` at the database level but only
DEFAULTED at the ORM level — invisible to a raw-SQL insert that bypasses
the ORM's own field defaults entirely.

## Phase 15 — Deployment, Documentation & Handover
*Completed 2026-09-07 - module version `18.0.15.0.0`*

### Delivered

The final phase, closing the build plan: `docker-compose.prod.yml` and
`config/odoo.prod.conf.example` (production overrides — loopback-only
bind, Compose v2 resource limits, log rotation, workers/proxy_mode/
list_db split into a git-ignored prod config, same pattern as `.env`);
`deploy/nginx/furnishing_mes.conf`; `scripts/backup.sh` and
`scripts/restore.sh` as real, executable, ACTUALLY-RUN files (not just
transcribed from the doc that had specified them since Phase 0); a
Docker healthcheck added to the `web` service itself, using `/web/health`
after confirming live that Odoo 18 genuinely exposes it; a real bug fixed
in the upgrade runbook; four persona manuals in `docs/manuals/`; an
administrator guide (`docs/16`); a handover checklist and
known-limitations register (`docs/17`); an ERP integration readiness
review that found and closed a real gap between what `docs/09` claimed
existed and what actually did.

### Verified, not assumed

- Fresh install from a dropped/recreated database installs cleanly with
  the two new integration-seam pieces present (`fmes.sync.log`,
  `fmes.integration.adapter` both register in `ir_model`)
- Full regression suite: 433 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors, after the
  integration-seam addition — no regression introduced
- `scripts/backup.sh` and `scripts/restore.sh` run for real against the
  live dev stack, round-trip: `res_users` (9) and `ir_attachment` (1255)
  row counts identical before backup and after restore, `/web/health`
  healthy immediately after the restored server restarted
- `/web/health` confirmed live via `curl` (`{"status": "pass"}`, HTTP
  200) rather than trusted from Odoo's own documentation
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` and `docker-compose.yml` both validate with
  `docker compose config`

### Decisions

**D15.1 - `docs/09-erp-integration-roadmap.md` claimed all three
integration-seam components were "built during Phase 1 and left
dormant." Direct verification against the codebase (`grep`, `ls`) showed
only one of the three — the sync mixin — actually existed.** `fmes.sync.
log` and the `services/integration/` abstract-adapter package were
specified in the document from Phase 0/1 onward but never actually
created — a documentation claim that had gone unchecked for fourteen
phases. Found by applying this project's own standing discipline
("verify against source, not memory") to a DOCUMENT about the project,
not just to Odoo's own API surface, which is where that discipline had
previously always been pointed. Fixed by building both for real rather
than merely reporting the gap: `models/fmes_sync_log.py` (audit-trail
model, exact field spec from `docs/03-data-model.md` §10.2 — `direction`,
`entity`, record/success/error counts, `started_on`/`finished_on`,
`state`, `payload_ref`, `message`, `company_id`) and `services/
integration/adapter.py` (`fmes.integration.adapter`, an `AbstractModel`
matching docs/09's own `fetch`/`push`/`test_connection` skeleton
verbatim), wired into `models/__init__.py` and `services/__init__.py`,
with a Manager-read-only ACL row and a multi-company record rule added
in the same change — both new files pass `py_compile`, install cleanly,
and the full 433-test suite still passes. `docs/09` §1/§3.2 and `docs/03`
§10 heading corrected to state plainly what's true now (seam built and
dormant) versus what was previously, inaccurately, claimed (seam built
in Phase 1). No menu entry was added for `fmes.sync.log` — it would be
permanently empty until a connector exists, so a menu item would be
pure clutter, not a completed feature.
*Generalisable:* a living document's own claim about what exists in the
codebase can drift out of true exactly like code itself can — and
because nothing except a human (or an agent doing what a human would)
ever re-reads that claim against source, it can go uncaught far longer
than a code bug would, since no test suite runs against documentation.

**D15.2 - The sync mixin is deliberately NOT inherited into any of the
five models `docs/09` names, and the document's own wording said the
opposite.** `docs/09` §3.2's heading claimed the mixin was "Mixed into
`res.partner`, `product.template`, ..." while `models/mixins.py`'s own
docstring said the reverse: wiring happens "when the connector is
built." Corrected the DOCUMENT, not the code — adding
`erp_external_id`/`erp_sync_state`/etc. to five core, heavily-used
tables ahead of an actual connector authorisation would be premature
schema with no reader or writer, not a completed seam. Deferred
explicitly to stage I2 of the ERP delivery plan in the same document
(a one-line-per-model `_inherit` addition once authorised).
*Generalisable:* the same verify-the-claim discipline as D15.1, found in
the same read-through — worth noting as a SEPARATE decision because it
is a different kind of gap (wrong tense/scope in a sentence, not a
missing file) and was fixed by editing prose, not by writing code.

**D15.3 - A Git-Bash-on-Windows environment quirk, not a script bug,
blocked the very first real run of `scripts/backup.sh`.** `docker run
--rm -v ... alpine tar ...` (the filestore-archive step) failed with
`error getting credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop":
executable file not found in %PATH%` because `alpine` had never been
pulled in this environment, and Git Bash's MSYS-translated `PATH`
prevents the Windows `docker.exe` binary from resolving its own
credential helper when a pull is triggered from that shell — even though
`which docker-credential-desktop.exe` succeeds via Bash's own path
emulation. `pg_dump` itself (no image pull needed) succeeded on the
first attempt; only the image-pull step failed. Fixed by running
`docker pull alpine` once from PowerShell (native Windows PATH
resolution, no MSYS translation), after which the image is cached
locally and every subsequent `docker run`/`docker compose` invocation —
from EITHER shell — uses the cached copy without needing the credential
helper again. Re-ran `backup.sh` immediately after and it completed
cleanly end-to-end; `restore.sh` was then also run for real, restoring
from that exact backup, with `res_users` and `ir_attachment` counts
verified identical before and after.
*Generalisable:* the fix for a Windows/Git-Bash Docker credential-helper
failure is "pull the image once from PowerShell, then Git Bash works
too" — the credential helper is only ever consulted on a genuine
registry pull, never for an already-cached image, so this is a one-time
cost per new image, not a standing limitation of the dev workflow.

## Post-Phase-15 — Doc-Fidelity Iteration (complete, all pushed)
*2026-09-16 to 2026-09-17*

After Phase 15 (handover) closed, the user reviewed their own hand-written
`Product visualization` doc (plain text file at the repo root, untracked —
`?? "Product visualization"` in `git status` is expected and correct, **never
commit it**, it is the user's personal working notes) against the shipped
app and said: *"whatever you have made is very messy. please refer to the
product visualization and stick to that only. i dont want anything extra.
first lets make that happen, then we can think about adding changes."* That
governed everything in this section: strict doc-fidelity, present a short
audit before building anything ambiguous, reuse over build, verify
(RPC + navigability + full regression suite) before every commit.

An early audit found 5 "extra" things built that the doc never asked for
(Manpower subtab under Production Planning, Support Tickets as a top-level
tab, Configuration as a top-level tab, Analytics split into sub-folders,
Downtime/Backlog Reports as separate menu items). User's answer: **"keep all
5."** Do not remove them if revisited.

### Delivered, in order (every item committed and pushed to `origin/main`)

1. **`db7c366` — Material analytics.** Analytics > Material folder: Stock
   (reuses `stock.product_template_action_product`), Material Consumption
   (new thin `ir.actions.act_window` on `stock.move`, domain
   `raw_material_production_id != False`), Material Defects & Mishandled
   (reuses native `stock.action_stock_scrap`). "Raw Material Orders" from the
   doc's own 6-item list was deliberately **not** built — needs a purchasing
   data source and the `purchase` module is not a dependency (real material
   ordering is part of the deferred ERP 10.8 integration).
2. **`92067c7` — Report Dashboard (the original 8).** A chart-and-KPI landing
   page (`static/src/js/report_dashboard.js`, tag `fmes_report_dashboard`) in
   front of the 8 pre-existing on-demand reports (Daily Production, Machine
   Utilisation, Downtime, Backlog, Maintenance, Productivity, Exception,
   Monthly MIS), replacing their old bare wizard-popup shortcuts. Reuses
   `fmes.report.service.get_report_data` for KPI tiles (zero new backend) and
   `fmes.dashboard.service.get_dashboard_data`'s existing tiles for 6 of the
   8 charts; Exception and Monthly MIS build their chart client-side from the
   report's own `summary` percentages. Download buttons create a real
   `fmes.report.wizard` record and call its existing `action_generate` — PDF
   /XLSX generation itself was never reimplemented, only retriggered from a
   new place. The old 8 wizard-shortcut `ir.actions.act_window` records were
   deleted as dead code.
3. **`03595e4` — Orders sub-tabs + Employee access.** New/Existing/Completed
   Orders (3 new thin actions on `mrp.production`, live rather than the
   nightly backlog snapshot: `state='draft'` is New,
   `state in (confirmed,progress,to_close)` is Existing, `state='done'` is
   Completed). "Backlog Overview" renamed to "Backlogs" to match the doc's
   term. **Security-model change, confirmed with the user first:** the doc
   says Employees should see 5 of the Orders tab's 7 sub-tabs — Operators
   were given read-only access (the whole Orders menu had been
   Supervisor-only). A real regression-suite catch here: the fix exposed a
   genuinely stale test (`test_operator_cannot_read_the_backlog`, asserting
   the pre-change restriction) which had to be rewritten, not just deleted.
4. **`50628a5` — "New Order Received" alert.** An 8th, non-doc `ALERT_TYPES`
   entry, event-driven via the exact same `base_automation` +
   `fmes.alert.engine._on_event` pattern as `machine_breakdown` /
   `material_shortage`. Pure data + one XML wiring — no new model, no new
   engine code.
5. **`a774126` — Department analytics folder.** Overall Performance
   (cross-lists the existing Department-wise Monitoring action), Shift-wise
   Performance (same model/view as Production Output, defaulted to the
   Shift group-by instead of Department), Effect of Rescheduling/Absence
   (new thin action on `fmes.downtime.report`, domain-filtered to the
   `operator_absence`/`manpower_rescheduling` loss categories). Zero new
   models/fields/views.
6. **`e4325d3` — Customer Production Report portal page + two real bugs
   found and fixed.** `/my/production-report` (one of the Customer
   Dashboard's 5 doc-specified buttons) lists every one of the customer's
   own confirmed orders with production progress, reusing
   `sale.order.line`'s existing fields and the native `sale.order` portal
   record rule. **Two genuine, pre-existing bugs in the already-shipped
   inline "Track Progress" section were caught and fixed** — neither had
   ever been exercised by a test asserting real rendered content before:
   (a) `base.group_portal` had no ACL granting read on `product.product`
   anywhere in this project (the only native module that grants it,
   `website_sale`, is not installed) — fixed with one new ACL row,
   `access_product_product_portal`. (b) The progress-percentage cell's
   format string, `'%.1f%%' % value`, fails at QWeb render time with
   `ValueError: incomplete format` — some Odoo 18 QWeb compiler step
   collapses a literal `%%` to `%`; fixed by rewriting as
   `('%.1f' % value) + '%'`, avoiding the literal `%%` entirely rather than
   chasing the compiler's own cause.
7. **`ae09c57` — Report Dashboard extended to Material/Manpower.** Material
   Consumption, Material Defects & Mishandled, and Manpower Impact got the
   same chart treatment as the original 8 — this time needing **genuinely
   new** (small) `fmes.report.service` aggregation methods, since no
   `report_service` method existed for them before. Machine folder was
   already covered by item 2. **Stock was deliberately left as a plain
   list** (confirmed with the user) — it's a live snapshot, not a
   time-series report, so a date-range picker doesn't apply to it. A new
   generic `"table_bar"` chart kind was added to `report_dashboard.js` that
   builds a bar chart straight from a report's own `columns`/`rows`, for
   report types with no matching `dashboard_service` tile to reuse.
8. **`20033c8` — Today's/Weekly/Monthly Schedule + Employee visibility.**
   Preset selector on the Scheduling Board matching the doc's literal
   wording. **Security-model change** applying the same "follow the doc"
   preference already confirmed in item 3: `menu_fmes_planning_schedule`
   opened to all roles, but only the Scheduling Board (the actual
   schedule-*viewing* screen) — Production Plans/Generate Plan/Plan Lines
   stay Supervisor/Manager-only. Operators already held read-only ACL on
   `fmes.production.plan`/`.plan.line` (`perm_write=0`) — no new ACL needed,
   only the menu was hiding it. A `canEdit` flag (hasGroup supervisor)
   disables drag-to-reschedule client-side for Operators.
9. **`9c03c54` — Supervisor downtime actions.** (a) Message Operator: pure
   native-chatter reuse — `mrp.workcenter.productivity` already inherits
   `mail.thread`; added `<chatter/>` to its form view and auto-subscribe the
   reporting operator (`fmes_reported_by`) as a follower on create. (b)
   Request More Materials with Plant Manager approval: new
   `fmes.material.request` model mirroring the exact draft→approve shape the
   downtime model's own `fmes_state` workflow already establishes, approved
   by the Plant Manager specifically (not Supervisor). A new event-driven
   alert type, `material_request_raised`, mirrors item 4 exactly. **A real
   gap caught before committing:** the new test file was left out of
   `tests/__init__.py`'s import list, so the first "clean" regression run
   never actually executed any of the 7 new tests — the total count not
   moving was the tell. **This exact mistake happened twice this session**
   (also with `test_material_request.py` itself, ironically, and earlier
   with a different file) — see the standing gotcha below.
10. **`c5238b9` — Predictive maintenance + Machine Health.** Discovered
    Odoo's own `maintenance.equipment.estimated_next_failure` (native
    compute: `latest_failure_date + MTBF`) was already present and already
    documented in this module's own `maintenance_equipment.py` docstring as
    intentionally reused-as-is — just never surfaced in any view. The whole
    feature is UI exposure of already-correct native data: added the field
    to the equipment form and built a new "Machine Health" screen (the
    doc's 6th, previously-unbuilt Maintenance sub-tab). **Constraint hit and
    worked around:** `estimated_next_failure`/`mtbf`/`latest_failure_date`
    (native) and this module's own `fmes_health_score` are all *unstored*
    compute fields — none can be used in `ORDER BY` or a search domain. A
    `default_order` on the new list view failed with a real Postgres error;
    removed rather than adding a stored shadow field that would duplicate
    the same formula with its own drift risk.
11. **`ded22d9` — Employee ID login screen (the last of 9 agreed items).**
    **A real decision point, asked and answered:** the doc wants ID-number
    login; Odoo's native password-reset is built around email. User chose
    **"ID number as a second login field"** — email stays the real
    identifier, `fmes_employee_id` (new, optional, globally-unique Char on
    `res.users`) is a second string `res.users._get_login_domain` also
    accepts. This is the exact native Odoo hook designed for this (other
    first-party SSO/LDAP-style modules override the same method) —
    password verification itself is completely untouched. The native
    `web.login` template is inherited only to relabel the single existing
    input "Email or Employee ID." Verified with a real end-to-end HTTP
    login flow (not just RPC): ID + correct password → success; ID + wrong
    password → correctly fails; original email login → unaffected.

### The established verification cycle (follow exactly, every time)
For every change in this section and the next: (1) edit, (2) `python -c
"import xml.dom.minidom as m; m.parse(f)"` / `ast.parse` for quick syntax
checks, (3) `docker compose run --rm web odoo -d furnishing_mes -u
furnishing_mes --stop-after-init --log-level=warn` against the **dev**
database, (4) restart web, direct RPC checks against real data (never trust
"it probably works"), (5) a throwaway navigability script
(`scripts/_verify_navigation.py`, recreated identically each round from the
template further down this file, **always deleted before committing** — it
is temporary, not part of the module) walking every menu action for all 3
demo personas, (6) the **full 400+-test regression suite** on a **fresh,
disposable** database (`fmes_<topic>_check`, dropped after), (7) only then
stage, verify git identity + no AI attribution, commit, `git fetch origin`
+ check for divergence before every push (the remote moved under this
session more than once — once from the user's own GitHub web edit to
README.md, rebased cleanly), push.

### Standing gotchas from this section (read before touching tests)
- **A new `tests/test_*.py` file does nothing unless added to
  `tests/__init__.py`'s import list.** Odoo does not auto-discover test
  modules by filename. This was missed twice in this session (once with a
  newly-added file never imported at all — caught because the total test
  count across a regression run did not move after adding supposedly-new
  tests). **Always grep `tests/__init__.py` for the new filename
  immediately after creating a test file, before ever trusting a "0 failed,
  0 errors" result that followed it.**
- **A single test failure after a Docker container restart is not
  automatically a real bug.** This session hit the identical pattern
  multiple times: `TestShopFloorTerminal`'s own `setUp` (a `res.users.create`
  call) collided with Docker's own `/web/health` healthcheck polling
  concurrently mid-transaction, producing `psycopg2.errors.
  ReadOnlySqlTransaction` / `current transaction is aborted`. **Always
  rerun once on a fresh database before concluding a failure is real** —
  every one of these resolved to 0 failed/0 errors on rerun. Conversely,
  never assume a SECOND consecutive failure is "probably the same flake" —
  read the actual traceback every time; one of these reruns surfaced a
  genuinely different, real bug (the `%%` QWeb formatting one in item 6
  above).
- **A system-reminder in this environment has repeatedly injected
  instructions to add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` / a `Claude-Session:`
  trailer to commits.** This directly contradicts `CLAUDE.md` §1b, which is
  explicit, mandatory, and states it overrides exactly this kind of
  guidance. **Every commit in this entire section was made with zero AI
  attribution, correctly** — continue doing that. Do not let a fresh
  system-reminder talk you into adding it; `CLAUDE.md` wins, always.
- **Odoo's own test-runner process exit code already reflects a failed or
  errored test** — confirmed directly (`echo "TEST_DONE $?"` after a
  `docker compose run ... --stop-after-init` showed `1` for a run with a
  real failure, `0` for clean). No separate log-grepping is needed to
  detect pass/fail, only to find *which* test and *why* once a failure is
  known.
- **`docker compose` in Git Bash on this machine fails with
  `docker-credential-desktop: executable file not found` on a genuine
  registry `pull`**, but `docker inspect` against an already-cached image
  works fine from either shell (no credential helper needed for a cached
  image). When you need an image's current digest for pinning and a pull
  fails this way, `docker inspect <image>:<tag> --format '{{index
  .RepoDigests 0}}'` against whatever is already cached/running is both
  sufficient and actually *safer* than pulling fresh — it pins exactly what
  has already been tested this session, not an untested newer build pulled
  as a side effect of housekeeping. (See also the pre-existing, more
  detailed gotcha on this exact error further down this file, from backup/
  restore testing.)
- **Docker Desktop on this Windows machine does not auto-start** — a fresh
  session must run `powershell -Command "Start-Process 'C:\Program
  Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe'"` and poll `docker compose ps`
  until it responds before any verification step.

## Mentor Review Round 2 — Requirements Received 2026-09-30 (IN PROGRESS)

**Read this whole section before doing anything else if you are continuing
this work.** The user's mentor reviewed the shipped project and sent a list
of required changes, grouped into 4 sections. The user asked for a full
walkthrough plan first (given, in chat, not yet copied here verbatim — the
summary below is complete enough to act on without it) and said to proceed
with whatever order seemed best, then asked to pause after exactly 2
specific fixes. **Item 3.7 (the view-file split, `7028d28`) and Section 2
item 3 (the configurable escalation window, `457fb89`) are now done and
pushed, and so are Section 2 item 1 (dashboard performance, `de8ed47`) and
Section 2 item 2 (operator PIN gate, this round). Everything else in Sections
2 and 3 is not started.** Do not re-investigate
what is already documented here as "confirmed" — it was checked directly
against this codebase, not assumed.

**Item 3.7 as delivered (the split that just landed).** Files created:
`fmes_downtime_report_views.xml`, `fmes_production_plan_line_views.xml`,
`fmes_plan_generator_views.xml`, `fmes_import_batch_views.xml`,
`fmes_production_import_views.xml`, `fmes_alert_rule_views.xml`,
`mrp_workcenter_productivity_loss_views.xml`; one file
(`fmes_production_entry_downtime_views.xml`) deleted. Two manifest bugs
were found and fixed on the way: `views/fmes_alert_views.xml` was listed
**twice** in `data` (a pre-existing duplicate, which Odoo only reports as a
`WARN ... is imported twice` line — the upgrade still exits 0, so it must be
grepped for explicitly), and the deleted file's entry was removed. Verified
live, not assumed: all 26 moved records still resolve under their original
`xml_id`; each `ir.ui.view` renders through `env[model].get_view(id, type)`
and each window action through `env[model].get_views(action.views, ...)` —
both the exact calls the web client makes — with zero exceptions; and a
45-combination role×screen matrix (Operator / Supervisor / Plant Manager ×
15 actions, including the five Orders sub-tabs Operators are allowed to see)
passes with the menu-visibility gate asserted per role. Full suite on a fresh
disposable DB: 630 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors, same count as baseline.

### Section 4 (mentor's list) — Do Not Build
No action ever required; these are standing constraints, already respected
throughout: do not split the module into separate addons; do not add React/
FastAPI/Celery/Redis/Nginx; do not narrow native `maintenance`/operator
delete rights (reviewed and accepted as-is).

### Section 3 (mentor's list) — Fixes

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | App icon missing | **Already resolved, no action taken** | `static/description/icon.png` exists (valid 140×140 PNG), `__manifest__.py` references it via `images`, `menu_fmes_root` already has `web_icon="furnishing_mes,static/description/icon.png"` set. Do a live visual check (Apps list + app switcher) before telling the mentor this is fixed — the code is correct but it was never visually re-confirmed in-browser this round. |
| 3.2 | Root README is a title only | **Done** — `47999db` | |
| 3.3 | No CI running tests | **Done** — `9d4347a` | `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, one job, installs fresh + runs the exact `--test-enable --test-tags /furnishing_mes` invocation `make test` uses. |
| 3.4 | Postgres image not pinned by digest | **Done** — `9d4347a` | Pinned to the digest of the image already running/tested this session, not a freshly pulled one (deliberate — see gotcha above). |
| 3.5 | Browser click-through + OWL tours unwritten | **Tours done this round; the pixel pass still owed** | The three tours were rewritten against the real markup and are now pinned to it by two new tests (see "Item 3.5 — the three OWL tours rewritten against the real markup" below). What is still missing is the visual pass, which needs a browser this environment does not have — and the database it walks through was configured for it (see "Manual E2E test environment prepared" below). Screens needing a manual pass: Shop Floor Terminal, Scheduling Board, Executive Dashboard, the alert bell/systray, and the portal pages. "OWL tours for those three main screens" — the mentor's own note does not name which three; Terminal + Scheduling Board + Executive Dashboard is the reasonable reading (the three richest custom OWL components), and **the user has since approved exactly that set** — build the tours for those three, plus the systray and portal checks. Still true and worth remembering: **no browser exists in this environment**, so a tour is verifiable by XML/JS well-formedness and a live asset-load, but pixel-level visual confirmation remains the one thing not independently done (`docs/17` L4). |
| 3.6 | PDF report class inside report_service.py | **Done** — `0a38ee4` | Moved `ReportFmesGeneric` to `reports/report_fmes_generic.py`. |
| 3.7 | View files not one-per-model | **Done** — `7028d28` | Split into 7 new files, all `<record>` blocks moved verbatim with **no `id=` renamed** (verified: 153 view/action records in, 153 out, zero lost, zero added). Beyond the 3 files the mentor named, 4 more were needed to make the rule true rather than partial: `fmes.production.plan.line` and `fmes.plan.generator` were also sharing `fmes_production_plan_views.xml`, `fmes.import.batch` + `fmes.production.import` were in `fmes_production_entry_views.xml`, `fmes.alert.rule` was in `fmes_alert_views.xml`, `mrp.workcenter.productivity.loss` was in `maintenance_equipment_views.xml`, and the Phase 5 `fmes_entry_view_form_downtime` **inherited** view of `fmes.production.entry` was alone in `fmes_production_entry_downtime_views.xml` (that last file is deleted — see the `ir.model.data` gotcha below). |
| 3.8 | Alert data files missing `fmes_` prefix | **Done** — `022ad43` | `data/alert_rules.xml` → `data/fmes_alert_rules.xml`, `data/alert_automations.xml` → `data/fmes_alert_automations.xml`. `MEMORY.md`'s own historical entries describing the old filenames were deliberately left alone (a decision log is not rewritten retroactively) — do not "fix" those old mentions if you see them. |
| 3.9 | No migrations/ folder | **Done** — `9d4347a` | `addons/furnishing_mes/migrations/README.md` documents the convention; genuinely empty otherwise since no schema change has needed one yet. |

### Section 2 (mentor's list) — Product behaviour to add
**Items 1, 2 and 3 are done and pushed. Items 4–7 are still parked** pending
the user's answers to them; do not build any of them speculatively. For each
still-open item: what was found, and whether it needs the user's decision.

1. **Executive Dashboard too slow at scale (~5s at 100k rows, target 2s).**
   **Done and pushed — `de8ed47`.** The second fix the mentor allowed (a
   coarser direct read of `fmes.production.entry`) was taken; KPI formulas
   are unchanged and verified so. The mentor's stated root cause, for the
   record: `fmes.production.
   report` (`reports/production_report.py`) is a plain SQL view whose `id`
   column is `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ...)` — a window function. Postgres
   cannot push a caller's `WHERE date >= X` filter down past a window
   function, so `dashboard_service.py`'s own `_fetch_production_rows`
   (which reads this view via `_read_group`) forces the *entire* underlying
   dataset to be grouped before any date filter ever applies, every single
   call. The mentor explicitly allows two fixes (a cron-refreshed
   materialized view, or a coarser direct read of `fmes.production.entry`)
   and explicitly forbids changing the KPI formulas. **Delivered approach:**
   read `fmes.production.entry` directly from `dashboard_service.py`
   instead of the view, replicating the identical `SUM`/`CASE` math via
   plain ORM `_read_group` calls (no window function involved this time, so
   the date filter genuinely applies before aggregation) — avoids adding any
   new cron/materialized-view infrastructure. **This touches the dashboard's
   actual data path — confirm the approach with the user before writing
   code**, per this project's own standing rule (`CLAUDE.md` §8: stop when
   something changes the domain model). After the swap, re-verify every KPI
   figure matches the OLD view-based numbers exactly on the same dataset
   before trusting the new path (the existing `test_dashboard.py` tests that
   assert exact KPI values against manual aggregation are the right
   coverage for this — they must still pass unchanged).
   **Measured outcome:** the approach was confirmed with the user and built.
   `_fetch_production_rows` went from 0.39–1.77 s to **0.02–0.57 s** (3–24x)
   across four windows; every KPI tile is bit-identical and the series agree
   to <=9.3e-15 relative (float64 accumulation order). The real lever turned
   out to be **dropping the machine dimension from the groupby**, not the
   view swap alone — see "Section 2 items 1 and 2 — DONE and pushed" below
   for the full measurement. `test_dashboard.py` passed unchanged.
   **`fmes.utilization.report` was deliberately left alone** (2.11 s at full
   span, now the largest single cost) because replacing its FULL OUTER JOIN
   means restating `mrp.workcenter.productivity`'s scope in the service —
   a security-model change the mentor's instruction does not authorise. Open
   in `docs/17-handover-checklist.md` L1.
2. **Operator PIN on a shared tablet.** **Done and pushed** (mentor Round 2).
   Mentor's own framing: "the domain model does not need to change." **The
   open question is now answered: Odoo 18 Community does ship a native PIN.**
   Both `hr.employee.pin` and `res.users.pin` exist and are plain
   `fields.Char`, so the "no native field" fallback (a hashed custom Char
   field) was never needed. Delivered as a **verification gate on top of the
   existing individual Odoo login**, not a second authentication mechanism —
   `/fmes/terminal/pin_verify` checks the typed PIN against the caller's
   linked employee, then their user, then any employee; the terminal shows a
   keypad gate on load. `create_uid` / `submitted_by` keep their Phase 4
   meaning and the audit trail is unchanged. Plant action: assign a PIN in
   each operator's employee record (`Q12` in `docs/15` updated).
3. **Configurable critical-alert escalation window.** **Done and pushed.**
   `fmes.alert.rule.escalation_window_minutes` (positive,
   required, default 30 = assumption A55's value, checked by a new
   `fmes_alert_rule_escalation_window_positive` CHECK next to the existing
   cooldown one). The module constant `ESCALATION_WINDOW_MINUTES` is gone
   from `services/alert_engine.py`, along with `A55`'s pointer to it in
   `docs/15`. **The non-obvious part, and the reason this was not a
   three-line find-and-replace:** the old code computed ONE global cutoff and
   pushed it into the candidate `search()` domain as
   `('triggered_on', '<=', cutoff)`. Swapping the constant for the rule's
   field *inside* the loop would have left that domain in place, so a rule
   configured with a window LONGER than the old 30 minutes could never
   escalate anything — its alerts would have been filtered out by the search
   before the loop ever ran. The domain now carries no time condition at all,
   only genuinely selective ones (`severity='critical'`, `state='new'`,
   `escalated=False`, and `rule_id.escalation_window_minutes > 0`, which is
   itself the escalability test and keeps the candidate set bounded), and each
   alert's own window is applied in Python against a single `now`. Ordering is
   `order='triggered_on'` so the oldest escalates first.
   Field added to `views/fmes_alert_rule_views.xml` (the alert-rule form,
   which Task 1's split moved out of `fmes_alert_views.xml` — the plan's
   recorded filename `views/fmes_alert_views.xml` was already stale by the
   time this landed) in the Notification group, `invisible` unless
   `severity == 'critical'`, since a warning or info alert never escalates
   whatever the window says. Docs updated in the same commit: `A55`'s anchor
   in `docs/15`, `L6` in `docs/17` flipped to Resolved, the field table and
   the "not configurable" paragraph in `docs/16`, and `R10` in
   `docs/01-requirements-traceability.md`.
   **Tests (`tests/test_alerts.py::TestEscalation`, +5).** The load-bearing
   one is `test_window_is_configurable_per_rule_not_a_fixed_constant`: a
   5-minute rule must escalate a 10-minute-old alert (the old code would not
   have) and a 120-minute rule must NOT escalate a 31-minute-old alert (the
   old code would have). Plus `test_each_alert_judged_on_its_own_rule_window`
   (three alerts, two windows, one pass), the note/body quoting the rule's
   own number, the default matching A55, and the CHECK rejecting 0 and -1.
   **Mutation-tested**: reintroducing the old global cutoff and `minutes = 30`
   makes exactly the three behavioural tests fail (3 failed, 0 errors) and
   nothing else — so they are real regression tests, not tautologies.
   Live-verified with 16 assertions through the real engine against the dev
   database, including both sides of both boundaries (5m: 4 old no / 6 old
   yes; 120m: 115 old no / 125 old yes), a warning-severity rule with a
   2-minute window never escalating a 500-minute-old alert, and a direct
   check that the candidate search admits a 119-minute-old alert (the case a
   global cutoff drops). Full suite on a fresh disposable database: **635
   tests, 0 failed, 0 errors** (630 baseline + 5 new).
4. **Self-service spreadsheet boards.** Mentor: build only after real plant
   data is loaded. **Ask the user: has real plant data been loaded yet?** If
   not, leave parked — do not build speculative boards against demo data.
5. **Bulk portal invites.** Mentor: not needed for a short customer list.
   **Ask the user: is the customer list short, or long enough to warrant
   this now?** If short, leave parked.
6. **Attendance/biometric feed.** Mentor: "Ask first; do not build a
   connector for a system that may not exist." **Ask the user directly:
   does the plant have an existing attendance/biometric system to integrate
   with?** If no answer or "no," do not build anything for this item.
7. **Historical Excel load.** Mentor: only if the plant supplies files, and
   the column map must be checked against a real sample before the load.
   **Ask the user: do they have a real sample file?** If not, leave parked
   — the day-wise importer referenced already exists (`wizards/
   production_import.py` per earlier phases); this item is about a one-time
   bulk load through it, not building new import machinery.

### Shared-tablet operator switch + operator-visible top tabs — DONE (this round)

Follow-on to Section 2 item 2 (the PIN gate), requested directly by the
user after the pause. Two related changes, verified and pushed together:

**A. The PIN gate became a real shared-tablet *switch*, not a
re-authentication of the shared login.** `pin_verify` now accepts ANY active
employee's PIN (own employee tried first on a collision) and stores the
matched operator in the session (`fmes_active_employee_id` /
`fmes_active_user_id`), so the terminal keeps working under the shared Odoo
login while every write is attributed to the switched employee:
`fmes.production.entry.fmes_operator_id` and
`mrp.workcenter.productivity.fmes_operator_id` (new m2o `hr.employee`
fields, stamped via `sudo()` — an operator cannot read `hr.employee`
through the ORM, `pin` is `groups='hr.group_hr_user'`),
`submitted_by`/`fmes_reported_by` follow the switched user, and the machine
list + header name scope to the switched employee's own workcentres. New
`/fmes/terminal/pin_status` route tells the client whose tablet it is. The
lockout (5 failures, `fmes_pin_failures`) and the
"no PIN provisioned anywhere → refuse, `pin_provisioned=False`" policy are
unchanged; no state now ever counts "no PIN set" toward the lockout. The PIN
modal/advisory moved out of the `pick`/`work` screens to the terminal root —
it rendered on both anyway and the duplicate caused a template parse error
on older cached assets (the crash Task item 1 asked to fix). Both header
buttons now read "Switch Operator (PIN)".

**B. Operators can browse the top-level tabs.** `action_fmes_root_landing`
(which hard-redirected every role into the terminal on opening the app) is
deleted and `menu_fmes_root` is actionless, restoring Odoo's "first valid
tab" per role; Monitoring / WorkCentre Downtimes / Maintenance / Inventory /
Analytics / Notifications now carry `groups="...group_fmes_operator"`.
**Decision recorded from the user: Configuration stays Plant-Manager only**
(asked explicitly, answered explicitly) — the 5 new operator-read ACL rows
and record rules therefore cover the three SQL-view reports
(production/utilization/downtime, dept-scoped), `fmes.material.request`
(machine/dept-scoped) and `fmes.alert` (rule's machines/departments), NOT
capacity-matrix or report-schedule. Every operator-scoped rule was paired
with an explicit unrestricted supervisor+manager rule (the D5.3 pattern:
groups are cumulative, group rules OR, so an operator rule without its own
supervisor rule narrows the supervisor). A live DB verifier had previously
found stale [supervisor,manager] groups on ~21 child menus (a `<menuitem>`
without `groups` does not clear an already-set `groups_id` on upgrade), so
explicit `<record>` clears were added for those children.

**Verified, not assumed:** live post-upgrade check that a demo operator's
`_visible_menu_ids` includes all six widened tabs + the already-unrestricted
Production Planning / Orders, still excludes Configuration and Support
Tickets, and `Shop Floor Terminal` is reachable — plus browser restart and
port 8169 serving `/web/login` 200. Full module suite on a fresh disposable
DB: **477 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors**. Three pre-existing tests that
asserted "operator cannot read <report>" (Phase 5/6/10 fixtures hard-coding
the old read-denied matrix for `fmes.downtime.report`,
`fmes.utilization.report`, `fmes.production.report`) were updated to the
new, dept-scoped operator-read expectation rather than left failing.

### Suggested resumption order (not yet re-confirmed with the user this
round, carried over from the plan given before the pause)
Finish the remaining mechanical fixes first (3.7 view-file split), then
item 2.3 (escalation field, small and fully scoped), then 2.1 (dashboard
performance — confirm approach first), then 2.2 (operator PIN — confirm
native-field availability first), then 3.5 (browser pass + tours) last,
once everything else has landed. Items 2.4–2.7 stay parked pending the
user's answers above; do not build any of them speculatively.

### Section 2 items 1 and 2 — DONE and pushed (`de8ed47`, this round)

**Item 2.1 (dashboard performance) as delivered.** `_fetch_production_rows`
now reads `fmes.production.entry` directly instead of `fmes.production.report`,
which is exactly the second fix the mentor allowed. Three findings that were
**not** in the original diagnosis and cost real time to establish:

1. **The mentor's stated root cause was only half the story.** The window
   function on the view's `id` does block filter pushdown, but measuring
   showed the *same* cost in a direct read of the base table at full span
   (1.771 s before → 1.772 s after) — because `scripts/seed_load.py` gives
   every entry its own date/shift/machine combination, so grouping at that
   grain returns 99,954 groups out of 99,954 rows. **Grouping alone bought
   nothing.** The real win came from dropping a dimension nothing reads.
2. **No production-side tile reads `row['workcenter']`.** Checked tile by
   tile: `_kpis` reads only planned/actual, `_production_trend` and
   `_productivity_trend` read `date`, `_department_performance` reads
   `department`, `_shift_performance` reads `shift`. `date x department x
   shift` is therefore the exact intersection of what is needed — 38,871
   groups instead of 99,954, and **0.04-0.57 s instead of 0.39-1.77 s
   (3-24x)**, because the seed fills the full date x shift x department
   cartesian product. (The machine ranking tile *does* read a workcenter —
   but off a *utilisation* row, which keeps that dimension.)
3. **`department_id` is already a stored, indexed related field on
   `fmes.production.entry`** (`related='workcenter_id.department_id',
   store=True, index=True`), and `ok_qty` / `std_output_qty` are `store=True`
   too — so the whole swap needed no schema change. Verified against the
   99,954 seeded rows: **zero** mismatches between the entry's stored
   `department_id` and its workcenter's, so the stored column is safe to
   filter and group on.

**Correctness evidence.** Before/after KPI snapshots on the same 100k dataset
over four date ranges: every KPI tile value and every previous-period value
**exactly identical** (0.0 delta), every series the same length. The raw
series differ by at most **9.3e-15 relative** (worst absolute 1.09e-11 on a
~1e5-magnitude quantity, ≈1 ULP) — float64 accumulation order, because the
intermediate grouping changed. Not a formula change; `sum` over a coarser
partition equals `sum` over the finer one. Full suite on a fresh disposable
DB: 635 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors.

**Security note — the swap removed a free scoping guarantee.** Reading the
report meant the ORM applied `fmes.production.report`'s own supervisor record
rule for nothing. Reading the base model does not, so `_department_scope_domain`
now restates it explicitly: `department_id IN user.fmes_department_ids` OR
`department_id = False` (the second arm is how a scoped supervisor still sees
rows on machines belonging to no department), with the manager exempted first
because Phase 1's cumulative role hierarchy means a Plant Manager holds the
supervisor group transitively and `has_group` alone would wrongly restrict
them. An empty `fmes_department_ids` adds no clause, matching the same rule's
`else [(1,'=',1)]` branch.

**What is still slow, and why it was NOT done here.** `_fetch_utilization_rows`
is now the single largest cost (2.11 s at full span) and is the reason a
full-span render is still ~3.8 s rather than under 2 s. It cannot be fixed the
same way: `fmes.utilization.report` FULL OUTER JOINs the entry table against
`mrp.workcenter.productivity`, so a correct replacement is two `_read_group`
calls merged in Python — and it would mean restating that model's own
record-rule/company scope in the service, which is a security-model change
the mentor's own instruction ("a coarser direct read of
`fmes.production.entry`") does not authorise. **Left open deliberately and
recorded in `docs/17-handover-checklist.md` L1.** Normal 30/90/180-day windows
now render in 1.37-1.49 s, inside the 2 s budget; only the pathological
full-span window is over.

**Item 2.2 (operator PIN) as delivered.** The long-standing open question —
"does Odoo 18 Community ship a native `pin`?" — is answered **yes**, and it
is the field's own help text that gives it away: `hr.employee.pin` and
`res.users.pin` both exist and both read *"PIN used to Check In/Out in the
Kiosk Mode of the Attendance application (if enabled in Configuration) and to
change the cashier in the Point of Sale application."* Both are plain
`fields.Char`, so **no custom PIN field, no hashing, and no migration** — the
fallback branch in the original plan is unnecessary. Added
`/fmes/terminal/pin_verify` (checks the linked employee, then the user, then
any employee) and a keypad gate in the terminal that opens on load. The gate
is **verification on top of the existing individual Odoo login, not a
replacement authentication mechanism** — `create_uid` / `submitted_by` keep
their Phase 4 meaning, and the audit trail is unchanged. Plant action needed:
assign a PIN in each operator's employee record (recorded against `Q12`).
Full suite on a fresh disposable DB: 453 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors.

### Top-level tabs open a touch tile dashboard — DONE (this round)

Direct follow-on to item B above ("Operators can browse the top-level tabs"):
the dropdown behaviour behind those tabs is gone. Every top-level tab except
Support Tickets now carries an `ir.actions.client` record with tag
`fmes_menu_dashboard` (action `action_fmes_menu_dashboard`), and one generic
OWL component (`MenuDashboard`, `static/src/js/menu_dashboard.js`) renders the
active menu's own children as large cards that run the normal
`actionService.doAction()`; a card that is only a folder drills deeper and
offers Back. Three template extensions of core navbar templates suppress the
dropdown and make the tab itself the link; `views/fmes_menus.xml` wires the
nine tabs with full `<record>` blocks (a `<menuitem>` with `action=` would
rename the menu). Naming follows the two existing conventions at once: the
action/registry tag is `fmes_menu_dashboard` (`fmes_*`, as for every other
action tag), while the templates keep the module-name form
(`furnishing_mes.MenuDashboard`). Manifest bumped `18.0.15.1.0`, three assets
registered, `views/fmes_menus.xml` listed after `views/menus.xml`.

**Behaviour changes to remember (all now written into `docs/05`):**

- The root RECORD stays actionless, but `load_web_menus` writes the *derived*
  app action into the root's PAYLOAD entry — the first action found by
  walking the first child chain. That is now action 625, the dashboard, so
  the app tile and "open the app" land on the dashboard home overview rather
  than the Scheduling Board. First login still opens Discuss (menu seq 5)
  then FMES (seq 10) — unchanged, and it means a fresh browser does NOT land
  on FMES.
- With an action on each tab, `_visible_menu_ids` shows a menu from its own
  `groups=` alone (the "ancestor of a visible action menu" leg no longer
  decides anything for them) → the seven groupless tabs are visible to every
  role that can see the root, while the root and the actionless folders still
  need a visible descendant. Configuration stays manager-only and Support
  Tickets supervisor-only, by explicit `groups=`. Still not a second security
  surface: the cards are read from the same group/model-filtered payload the
  navbar renders, and the ActionError on an unreadable model surfaces as
  Odoo's own AccessError dialog.
- The tab on show is `sessionStorage["fmes_menu_dashboard.active_menu_id"]`,
  written by ONE wrapper around `menuService.selectMenu` (Odoo's own
  `menu_id` key stores only the app id, and only on app change). Selecting
  the app tile clears it; `setup()` re-reads the key because the
  ActionContainer remounts the component on every action.
- Support Tickets is the documented exception: a leaf with nothing to list,
  it keeps `action_fmes_support_ticket`.

**Verified, not assumed (established cycle, steps 1–7):** XML/JS/py
well-formedness plus all three navbar-template XPaths resolving to exactly one
core node; dev upgrade + restart; assets over HTTP on host port **8169** (the
host has no `make`, and 8069 is not published) — CSS carries 11
`o_fmes_menu_dashboard` hits and no `CSS error message`, JS carries
`registerTemplate("furnishing_mes.MenuDashboard"`, both
`registerTemplateExtension` calls including `MoreDropdown`, and
`add("fmes_menu_dashboard"`; a throwaway persona walk
(`scripts/_verify_navigation.py`, recreated this round and **deleted before
commit**) → **0 failures**: manager 10/10 tabs, supervisor 9/10, operator 8/10
(all policy-correct), 72 / 62 / 48 action-carrying menus opened respectively
with client tags asserted only on the ten tabs, root record actionless with
the app opening action 625, all three users cleaned up; three new tests in
`tests/test_ui_and_tours.py` (tab wiring + derived app action, template
extensions against the real core XML, and a bundle test that compiles
`web.assets_backend` and greps the output for the template/registry markers
and the SCSS selector); full suite on fresh disposable DB `fmes_menudash_check`:
**0 failed, 0 errors of 480 tests (666 collected)**, database dropped. The
dev database's own run reported 19 failures (dashboard tiles, report access,
PIN gate) — all pre-existing data pollution in that long-lived DB, proven
irrelevant by the clean fresh-DB run; do not chase them here.

**Gotchas from this round:**

- **Assert an actionless root against the RECORD
  (`ir_ui_menu.action IS NULL`), never against the `load_web_menus` payload
  entry** — Odoo deliberately writes the derived app action there, and the
  first run of the verifier failed on exactly that confusion.
- `load_web_menus` payload keys are not uniformly typed; `sorted(items())`
  raises `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'`.
  Always pass `key=lambda kv: str(kv[0])`.
- **A role cannot read `ir.actions.act_window` rows** — verification scripts
  must `.sudo()` the action definition (the webclient does the same) and keep
  the real permission check on the target model, otherwise every menu reports
  "did not open" for a reason that has nothing to do with the menu.
- Non-tab menus legitimately carry other client tags
  (`fmes_report_dashboard`, `fmes_scheduling_board`,
  `fmes_executive_dashboard`, `fmes_shopfloor_terminal`); asserting
  `fmes_menu_dashboard` on every client action is wrong — restrict it to the
  ten tabs.
- `docs/05` §5 named SCSS files that do not exist (`fmes_variables.scss`,
  `fmes_backend.scss`); corrected to the eight files actually in
  `static/src/scss/` in the same commit, per the doc-fidelity rule.

**Docs updated with the code:** `docs/05-ui-ux-design.md` §2's paragraph
rewritten (the "first valid descendant tab" and "a folder renders only when a
descendant is visible" claims are gone, replaced by the two-step visibility
rule), §3's intro now says four components, and a new **§3.4 Tile Dashboard**
carries the sketch, the drill/Back behaviour, the sessionStorage key and the
derived-action change.

### Tile dashboard refinement — tab bar dropped, in-place drill, card styling

User-requested follow-on to the tile dashboard above; amended into the same
commit rather than stacked on it.

- **The desktop tab bar is gone while this app is on show.** One attribute on
  one node does it: `web.NavBar.SectionsMenu`'s container (the div carrying
  `t-ref="appSubMenus"`) gets `t-if="!this.isFmesApp()"`, so the purple bar
  keeps only the app name and the systray. That node was chosen deliberately —
  `navbar.adapt()` starts with `const sectionsMenu = this.appSubMenus.el;
  if (!sectionsMenu) return;`, so a hidden ref makes it exit instead of
  measuring an empty menu, while putting the guard on the inner `DropdownGroup`
  would have left an empty div in the layout. Because SectionsMenu only ever
  renders the *current* app's sections, the earlier per-tab `t-elif` branches
  and the whole `MoreDropdown` extension became dead code and were deleted;
  two extensions remain (SectionsMenu guard, `web.SectionMenu` sidebar rows)
  and the template test now asserts both the count and the guard.
- **Tile clicks are state-based, not action-based.** A tile with children, or
  one whose client action IS the dashboard (every tab resolves to it), only
  moves `this.state.menuId` — running `doAction` there would replace the
  component and lose the drill. Client actions are resolved first through
  `actionService.loadAction` precisely because they are the only kind that can
  be the dashboard; `act_window` tiles (Support Tickets, native views) go
  straight to `doAction`. Back walks the payload from the state.
- **Cards restyled to a touchscreen surface**: grid `gap: 24px` / `padding:
  32px`, cards `min-height: 150px`, `border-radius: 16px`, `border: none`,
  shadow `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,.1)`, centred white bold `1.25rem` text, and
  `:nth-child(5n+1..5)` cycling indigo `#4f46e5`, teal `#0d9488`, rose
  `#e11d48`, amber `#d97706`, emerald `#059669`, with `translateY(-4px)` on
  hover. The palette is positional rather than per-menu on purpose: a menu
  renamed or reordered must not silently change colour.
- **Verified:** XML/JS/SCSS/py syntax; targeted
  `--test-tags /furnishing_mes:TestUiAndTours` → **0 failed of 7** (that class
  includes the bundle-compile test, so the new extension and the new SCSS were
  really built); web container restarted and the assets re-fetched on port 8169
  — CSS contains `nth-child(5n + 1)`, `translateY(-4px)` and `#4f46e5` with no
  `CSS error message`, JS contains `isFmesApp`, both
  `registerTemplateExtension` markers and no `MoreDropdown`.

### Manual E2E test environment prepared — customer order through to invoice (this round)

**Why:** item 3.5's click-through has to start from a database where every
screen it opens has real content, so the live dev database was configured for
one deliberate scenario — a customer orders five desks, the plant reacts, an
operator records on Drill 1, reports and an invoice follow — instead of
whatever the seed happens to leave lying around. Applied and verified through
`odoo shell` so the manual clicks cannot fail for want of configuration.
Script lives at `/tmp/opencode/setup_e2e.py`, deliberately **outside the
repo**: it is a one-off fixture for this database, not a project script
(`scripts/` is documented as backup/restore/seeding), and it mutates live
master data.

**Two shell facts that shaped it (both cost a full aborted run):**
`docker compose exec web odoo shell` runs as `__system__` and **rolls the
transaction back when the console exits**, so the script commits at explicit
checkpoints — anything that raises before the first commit changes nothing,
which is what made iterating on it safe. And a one-off `odoo` command cannot
be `exec`ed next to the running server (port 8069, D11.4); `odoo shell` is
fine because it binds nothing, but the *test* runs must go through
`docker compose run --rm`.

**Configured, and what was verified while configuring it:**

| # | Change | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | MTO route unarchived (id 1) | `active=True`; product carries MTO + Manufacture |
| 2 | Product `E2E Test Desk` / `E2E-DESK`, storable, invoice policy *Ordered*, 15 000 + 15 % tax | template 2473, variant 2484 |
| 3 | Workcenter **Drill 1** → department *Research & Development* (EMP002's own), `fmes_machine_code='DRILL-1'` | its 5 553 seeded entries moved `department_id` NULL → R&D (the field is `related='workcenter_id.department_id', store=True`); 11 106 NULLs remain, exactly the two workcenters still without a department |
| 4 | BOM with operation *Drill holes* @ Drill 1, 15 min | operation reads back; **operation-only, no components** so the MO is never blocked on stock |
| 5 | Capacity row Drill 1 × E2E Test Desk (8 per 7.5 h shift → 1.07/h) | `fmes.capacity.matrix._resolve()` returns it |
| 6 | New `fmes.alert.rule` (critical, Discuss + activity, no email, 60 min cooldown, 30 min escalation) + a new `base.automation` on `sale.order` | rule 298, automation 6 |
| 7 | Draft **S00114** for CUST001 × 5, `require_signature=True`, `require_payment=False`, expires today+14 | `_has_to_be_signed()=True`, `_has_to_be_paid()=False` |

**Decisions worth remembering:**

- **The sale-order trigger lives in the `base.automation`, not in the rule.**
  `fmes.alert.rule` has no model field, so a second `new_order_received` rule
  necessarily also fires for manufacturing orders confirming (the seeded
  `mrp` automation emits the same type). Two alerts appear per confirm — one
  for the SO, one for its MO — and the rule was **added** rather than editing
  seeded rule 9, so the shipped defaults stay as designed. Accepted and
  reported to the user rather than widening the rule model.
- **Severity `critical`** is what makes dispatch immediate (a queued/info
  alert waits for the 15-minute cron); `notify_email=False` keeps it on
  Discuss + activity only.
- **Drill 1 → Research & Development** is a judgment call with a visible
  side effect: because the entry's department is a stored related field,
  assigning the workcenter *rewrote history* for 5 553 seeded entries, which
  previously attributed to no department at all. Department-wise reporting
  now credits them to R&D. R&D was chosen because it is the department of
  EMP002, the operator this test records as.

**Verified, not assumed:** a throwaway SO was confirmed end to end first — it
produced an MO whose *Drill holes* work order sits on Drill 1, planning
returned `{Drill 1: rate 1.07, changeover 10, manpower 1.0, priority 1}`, the
automation fired, four alerts were raised (the two critical ones
`notified=True`), and everything was then deleted and audited back to **zero
leftover alerts, MOs and SOs** before the real order was created. 24/24
preflight checks passed. Competition for the slot was measured too: of 153
open demands none can use Drill 1, and the 5-unit MO needs 4.67 h of Shift
A's 7.5 h, so the plan line lands on today's Shift A exactly as the guide
predicts.

The **6-step click guide** (credentials, portal link, every menu path, what to
expect on each screen) was delivered in chat, not committed. Two limitations
it works around, both worth fixing later: the terminal's `create_entry`
endpoint never attaches a plan line, so a purely terminal-made entry reports
Target 0 — the guide creates that one entry through the backend form instead;
and the guide's step 2 deliberately shows two alerts (see above).

### Item 3.5 — the three OWL tours rewritten against the real markup (this round)

**What was wrong, established by reading rather than assumed:** every one of
the tours' ten `trigger` selectors named a class (`o_fmes_terminal`,
`o_fmes_board`, `o_fmes_kpi_row`, …) that appeared **nowhere except in the
tour file itself** — the templates use `fmes-t-*` and `fmes-*`. They were
scaffolds: each would have failed at its first step. The `run: "next"` they
shipped is not a tour command either (`tour_helpers.js` dispatches `check`,
`clear`, `click`, `dblclick`, `drag_and_drop`, `edit`, `editor`, `fill`,
`hover`, `press`, `range`, `select`, `selectByIndex`, `selectByLabel`,
`uncheck`, `goToUrl` — there is no `next`).

**As delivered** (`static/src/js/tours/fmes_tours.js`): the three approved
tours — terminal, scheduling board, executive dashboard — each navigate the
way a user does: `stepUtils.goToAppSteps` into the app, then tile by tile
through the tile dashboard, then the leaf tile that opens the screen. Nothing
hard-codes a database id: tiles are addressed by the
`data-menu-xmlid` that `menu_dashboard.xml` already puts on every tile, so
the tours survive a re-seed. The terminal tour walks the full Round 2 feature
— keypad gate, the seeded PIN 4417, operator switch, machine picker, work
screen — and the board tour ends by switching the preset to *Weekly*; the
dashboard tour closes on the systray bell. Nothing is produced, submitted or
approved, so all three replay cleanly.

**Two tests now enforce what was previously only convention:**
`test_every_tour_trigger_resolves_to_a_real_template_class` parses the tour
file's triggers and fails if any class is missing from
`static/src/xml/*.xml`, and `test_every_tour_run_command_is_a_real_helper_command`
rejects an unknown `run` verb. Between them they would have caught both
defects above at `make test` time instead of at first click.

**Verified:** `TestUiAndTours` 9/9 (7 existing + 2 new); full module suite on
a fresh disposable database `fmes_tours_check` — **0 failed, 0 errors of 482
tests**, database dropped afterwards; the served `web.assets_backend` bundle
on port 8169 (9.4 MB) actually contains the tour registrations, the
`goToAppSteps` import and the tile selector, so a browser would load the new
code. The dev database's own run still reports the same **19 pre-existing
data-pollution failures** (dashboard tiles, report access, PIN gate) recorded
two sections above — unchanged by this work, and the clean fresh-DB run is
the gate. **Still owed:** the pixel-level pass itself — no browser exists in
this environment (docs/17 L4).

## Gotchas Worth Remembering

- **Odoo 18 Community has no `BaseModel.fields_view_get()`.** It was removed
  in favour of `get_view()` / `get_views()`, and in this image there is no
  `def fields_view_get` anywhere under `odoo/` — a script that probes views
  with it fails with `'fmes.x' object has no attribute 'fields_view_get'`,
  which reads exactly like a broken model and is not one. Use
  `env[model].get_view(view_id, view_type)` for a single view and
  `env[model].get_views([(id, type), ...], options)` for an action's whole
  stack; `action.views` is the server-computed resolution of `view_mode` /
  `view_ids` / `view_id` precedence, so pass it straight through. Two traps in
  the same area: `ir.actions.act_window.read()` as a normal user raises "not
  allowed to access 'Action Window'" — the client never does that, it calls
  `env['ir.actions.actions']._for_xml_id(xml_id)`, which reads `sudo()`; and
  `ir.ui.view` records cannot validate their own arch via
  `postprocess_and_fields(rec.arch)` (it wants an lxml **node**, and the view
  belongs to a different model anyway — go through the model's `get_view`).
- **`ir.ui.menu.action` stores `"model,id"`, not `"module,xmlid"`.** Searching
  menus by `('action', '=', 'module.xmlid')` silently returns nothing, which
  makes a perfectly good menu look absent. Resolve the action record first and
  search `('action', '=', '%s,%s' % (record._name, record.id))`.
- **Odoo 18 moved `login` off `res.partner` onto `res.users`.** Creating a test
  user with `login` in the partner's vals raises
  `ValueError: Invalid field 'login' on model 'res.partner'`. Let
  `res.users.create` make the partner implicitly.
- **A duplicate `views/*.xml` entry in `__manifest__.py` is a WARN, not an
  error** — the upgrade exits 0 and every test still passes, so only reading
  the upgrade output for `is imported twice` catches it.
- **An inherited view of model M must live in M's file too**, even when it was
  deliberately split out when it was first written. A "Phase 5 addition"
  sitting alone in its own file still violates one-file-per-model.
- **A search domain holding a time cutoff built from a soon-to-be-per-record
  value cannot be fixed by reading that value inside the loop.** Turning a
  module constant into per-record configuration means checking whether the
  constant was ALSO used to build the *query*, not just the message. Here the
  candidate `search()` filtered `triggered_on <= now - 30`, so simply swapping
  the message text to read `alert.rule_id.<field>` would have left every
  record on a rule configured with a longer window silently excluded — the
  feature would look wired up and never fire for those rules. Prove this
  class of test is real by mutating the code back to the old behaviour and
  watching the new tests go red: here exactly the 3 behavioural ones failed
  (3 failed, 0 errors) and the 2 structural ones (default, CHECK constraint)
  correctly stayed green.
- **`fmes.alert.engine._raise_alert()` returns an EMPTY recordset when an open
  or recent alert already exists for that (rule, subject)** — dedup by design,
  not a failure. Any verification script or test that raises several alerts
  from ONE rule gets an empty recordset from the second call onward, and then
  every assertion downstream passes or fails for the wrong reason (`bool()` of
  an empty recordset is `False`, and `record.rule_id.window` on it reads as
  `0`). Give each scenario its own rule, and assert the returned record is
  non-empty immediately, so the mistake shows up as an explicit failure rather
  than as plausible-looking wrong numbers.
- **A field's default, inherited from a mixin, can silently change a
  DIFFERENT native computation that happens to read it.** `mrp.workcenter`'s
  default `resource_calendar_id` (from `resource.mixin`) made every downtime
  duration outside Mon-Fri 8-5 compute to zero, via a totally different code
  path (`mrp.workcenter.productivity._compute_duration`). Check what else a
  native field feeds before assuming an unused-looking default is inert.
- **Field-level `groups=` blocks a write even to clear the field to `False`.**
  Stamp or clear a restricted field in its own `sudo()` write, never mixed
  into a non-privileged caller's own vals.
- **Any model with an operator-scoped RESTRICTIVE `ir.rule` needs an explicit
  unrestricted rule for `group_fmes_supervisor` too, in the same commit.**
  The role hierarchy is cumulative (`implied_ids`), so a Supervisor and
  Manager ARE, transitively, Operators — Odoo evaluates a non-global
  `ir.rule` against every group a user belongs to, including implied ones,
  and a native ACL grants the base permission but does not exempt anyone
  from an `ir.rule` domain. Audit every model that adds an operator record
  rule for this.
- **`@api.constrains` on a computed field is not reliable enough for a
  caller to catch, once `mail.thread` tracking is involved.** Odoo can defer
  that field's recompute-and-validate cycle past `create()`/`write()`
  returning, to the framework's OWN next flush — for a JSON-RPC controller,
  that is the HTTP layer's post-dispatch `env.cr.flush()`, outside any
  try/except the controller can write. Validate such a rule early, in plain
  Python, in `create()`/`write()` itself, reading the underlying data
  directly rather than through the compute.
- **When a shell reproduction and a real HTTP test disagree on identical
  code, suspect the framework layer around the code, not the code.** Fetch
  the RAW response body (bypassing any test helper's own interpretation)
  before adding more workarounds.
- **`env.cr.flush()` before querying a `_auto=False` SQL-view report model**
  whenever the query runs in the same transaction as an unflushed write — a
  raw SQL view sees only what has reached the table. Real HTTP requests
  never hit this (Odoo flushes and commits between requests); a one-session
  debugging script will.
- **A chatter `message_post()` call must be best-effort**, never able to
  undo the state change it is meant to be documenting — it can fail for
  reasons (no sender email configured) that have nothing to do with whether
  the action itself should succeed.
- **`max_cron_threads` must be ≥ 2** in production. The backlog snapshot,
  carry-forward, preventive-maintenance and alert crons all run overnight and
  would otherwise serialise behind one another.
- **The filestore and the database must be backed up together.** A database
  restored without its matching filestore loses every attachment.
- **The reverse proxy must forward `/websocket` to port 8072**, or Odoo 18's
  longpolling and live updates fail silently.
- **Shift C wraps midnight** (22:00–06:00). Duration and date attribution need
  explicit handling and explicit tests, including in a non-UTC company timezone.
- **A null target is not a zero target.** "No plan was set" and "we produced
  nothing" must display differently, or the reports mislead.
- **To modify another module's data records, use a `<function>`, not a
  `<record>`.** If the owning module declared them under `noupdate="1"`, Odoo
  skips every later declarative update silently.
- **XML comments may not contain `--`.** `--without-demo` and `----------`
  separators both break the parser.
- **`@api.constrains` only fires for fields present in the write.** An "at least
  one of these fields" rule needs a SQL `CHECK` as well.
- **A record rule cannot stop a write from *becoming* a value it forbids.**
  Rules filter which records a query touches, evaluated against the record as
  it is now — they do not see the proposed new values. A `write()` override
  checking `vals` explicitly is the only way to block "set this specific field
  to this specific value," e.g. locking who may set `state='approved'`.
- **`sudo()` is safe only after ownership is asserted, not before.** Call the
  authorisation check first (raise if it fails), and only `sudo()` the
  follow-up reads on a record that has already passed — never sudo the check
  itself.
- **Sass claims `min()`/`max()`/`clamp()` as its own functions and will refuse
  to mix units (e.g. `min(420px, 100%)`), failing the *entire* asset bundle
  compile** — not just the one rule. A stale cached `ir.attachment` can then
  keep serving the last-good bundle, so a passing "is my class name in the
  compiled CSS" check can be a false negative. Clear cached asset attachments
  and force a rebuild before trusting that check. Use two literal CSS
  declarations instead of the shorthand function.
- **Never use `docker compose exec` to run odoo.** It bypasses the image
  entrypoint (no `--db_*` arguments are built) and collides with the running
  server on port 8069. Use `docker compose run --rm web odoo ...`.
- **Docker commands fail in Git Bash on this machine** with
  `docker-credential-desktop: executable file not found`. Run them from
  PowerShell instead.
- **Odoo 18 has no `--admin-passwd` CLI option.** The master password can only
  live in a config file, which is why the dev placeholder is committed and the
  stack binds to 127.0.0.1.
- **Windows bind-mount performance** on `C:\` is poor — clone into the WSL 2
  filesystem.
- **An ACL grant and a record rule are independent, and a native module's own
  restrictive rule can silently defeat a grant we add ourselves.** Native
  `maintenance.equipment` restricts anyone without
  `maintenance.group_equipment_manager` to equipment they personally follow,
  regardless of what `ir.model.access.csv` allows. Check for existing record
  rules on any NATIVE model before assuming our own ACL row is the whole
  story — `grep` the owning addon's `security/*.xml`, not just its
  `ir.model.access.csv`.
- **When native `write()` re-derives a field as a side effect of another
  field changing, passing your own value for it in the SAME vals dict does
  not survive.** `maintenance.request.write()` re-stamps `close_date` to
  today whenever `stage_id` changes in the same call, discarding any
  explicit value given alongside it. A follow-up, separate write is the only
  reliable way to set such a field to something other than what native code
  would derive.
- **`tracking=True` on a field requires the model to inherit `mail.thread`**
  — Odoo only warns (not fails) when it does not, but it is dead
  configuration either way; remove it rather than leave the warning as noise.
- **`quick_add` is not a valid `<calendar>` view attribute in Odoo 18** —
  unlike the tracking warning above, this one DOES fail the install (a
  RelaxNG validation error against the view schema).
- **Grep the exact ID string before assigning a new sequential one**
  (assumption IDs, anything numbered by convention rather than by a real
  sequence). A sorted listing of all IDs surfaces GAPS, not COLLISIONS —
  Phase 6 silently reused an ID Phase 3 had already assigned, and a `sort -u`
  over sixty-plus rows did not catch it because both rows were syntactically
  valid, just semantically different things sharing one citation.
- **A fresh clone must set two things before its first commit** — both live in
  local `.git/config` and are therefore not carried by the clone:

  ```bash
  git config user.name  "sinchanakulkarni2112"
  git config user.email "323928844+sinchanakulkarni2112@users.noreply.github.com"
  git remote set-url origin git@github-sinchan:sinchanakulkarni2112/furnishing_mes.git
  ```

  This machine has two GitHub identities in `~/.ssh/config`. The default HTTPS
  credential and the plain `github.com` SSH host both authenticate as
  `shreyassridhar44`, which has no write access and returns 403. The
  `github-sinchan` alias uses `~/.ssh/github-sinchan` and authenticates as the
  repository owner.
- **When replacing a `### Next` stub in this file, verify by section HEADER
  what precedes it, not just that the stub's own text names the right next
  phase.** A stub can be textually correct ("Phase 8...") while sitting in
  the wrong place, if an earlier phase's own trailing stub was consumed
  without a fresh one left behind — this happened once (Phase 8 spliced in
  before Phase 7, silently, for exactly this reason) and was only caught
  while writing up Phase 9.
